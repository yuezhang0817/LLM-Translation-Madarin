Editorial: What Has China Done Right to Improve Its Global Favorability?
"The American political news website Axios, citing a public opinion survey by the U.S. firm Morning Consult covering 41 countries, reported that China's global favorability has been on a steadily rising trajectory over the past year, with an accelerated increase since March this year. As of the end of May, China's global net favorability stood at 8.8, while the U.S. figure was -1.5. This marks the first time since the agency began tracking that China's global favorability has surpassed that of the United States. This is not an isolated case; several international surveys in recent years have pointed to the same trend— the world's view of China is becoming increasingly friendly and positive."
"The global increase in goodwill towards China is attributed to its consistent role as a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of international order. These efforts and achievements have had a positive impact on the international community. China's development and progress have not only benefited its own people but have also made significant contributions to world peace and development. China's contribution to global economic growth remains around 30%, and its economic growth rate is among the highest of major economies. Over the past decade, the Belt and Road Initiative has become a visible and tangible change in the lives of countless ordinary people. In Africa, hydropower stations built with the participation of Chinese companies have illuminated thousands of homes; in Southeast Asia, industrial parks supported by Chinese technology and investment have risen from the ground. These projects come without political conditions or patronizing lectures, but rather sincerely respond to the urgent desire of partner countries to develop their economies and improve people's livelihoods. What the world perceives is China's inclusive and benevolent approach of ""true development is achieved when everyone develops together."""
"From mediating the reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran to actively implementing the Paris Agreement, from promoting the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to advocating for the expansion of the BRICS cooperation mechanism, China has demonstrated the image of a responsible major power to the world. Behind this are advanced guiding principles and pragmatic actions. Since their proposal, the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative have received positive responses and support from over 100 countries and international regional organizations, injecting valuable stability and positive energy into a world intertwined with chaos. By actively contributing to global development aid projects, promoting political solutions to hot issues, and injecting new momentum into strengthening dialogue among civilizations, China accurately grasps the trend of the times, focuses on the common well-being of all humanity, reflects the shared aspirations of people worldwide for peace and development, and is gaining increasingly widespread global recognition."
"The rise in favorable views towards China also reflects the world's recognition and respect for a confident, independent, justice-upholding, and benevolent major power. In the face of rising unilateralism and protectionism, China firmly stands on the right side of history, promoting the construction of an open world economy. Confronted with hegemonism and power politics, China consistently upholds justice and fairness, steadfastly maintaining an international order based on international law and promoting its development towards a more just and reasonable direction. Additionally, a country's positive image is also reflected in the continuous enhancement of its soft power. Today, China's cultural creativity is embracing the world with unprecedented vitality. From ""Genshin Impact"" and ""Black Myth: Wukong"" to TikTok and Xiaohongshu, from the overseas popularity of micro-dramas and the DeepSeek phenomenon to ""China Travel"" and ""Jia Kang Ge,"" these phenomena and products have broken through the information cocoon long woven by Western media, allowing the world to see a real China that is technologically advanced, rich in history, and filled with warm and cheerful people."
"The world's goodwill also stems from China's open and inclusive mindset and its confidence in the future. China is well aware that openness brings progress, while isolation inevitably leads to backwardness. We continue to expand our ""circle of friends"" by offering visa-free access, consistently shorten the negative list for foreign investment, and optimize the business environment, allowing global enterprises to share in the dividends of China's development. According to the latest survey released by HSBC, among more than 5,700 multinational companies across 13 global markets, the proportion choosing China as a target market is the highest worldwide. China's innovative breakthroughs in fields such as high-end manufacturing, green energy, and artificial intelligence not only drive its own high-quality development but also contribute ""China solutions"" with leading technologies and quality services to address common challenges faced by humanity."
"The rise in China's global favorability is by no means accidental. It is the natural result of China's decades of dedicated effort and peaceful development; it is the inevitable response to the adherence to consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, and the practice of true multilateralism; it is the era's tapestry painted by countless Chinese enterprises, cultural workers, and ordinary citizens through sincere cooperation, innovative products, and friendly smiles. This goodwill is a recognition of China's path, an affirmation of China's contributions, and a vivid illustration of the deeply rooted concept of a community with a shared future for mankind. It reminds us that the shaping of a great nation's image lies not in aggressive rhetoric, but in subtle, impactful practice; not in deliberately crafted ""personas,"" but in consistently ""doing the right thing."" By steadfastly advancing along this path of win-win cooperation, openness, and inclusiveness, a credible, lovable, and respectable image of China will become clearer and warmer in the hearts of people around the world."
