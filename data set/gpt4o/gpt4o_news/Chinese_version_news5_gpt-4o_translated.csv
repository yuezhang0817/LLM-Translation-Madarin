"Editorial: Washington Should Not Be Surprised by China's ""Tit-for-Tat"" Response"
"What exactly has happened between China and the United States? Why has the trade friction, which had already cooled down, ""reignited""? How far will both sides go in this ""tit-for-tat"" confrontation? These are topics of high concern in international public opinion in recent days. Since the Sino-U.S. trade talks in Madrid, the U.S. has continuously introduced a series of new restrictive measures against China, attempting to coerce China by escalating tariff threats and various regulatory actions. After encountering China's firm countermeasures, the U.S. hurriedly attempted to ""extinguish the fire."" This roller-coaster change once again exposes the arbitrariness and shortsightedness of its trade policy, indicating that Washington has still not fully learned its lesson and has failed to truly understand the correct way for China and the U.S. to interact."
"The sudden change in the economic and trade atmosphere between the two parties was unexpected for many, but not surprising. The direct trigger for this round of escalating tensions in economic and trade relations is the U.S. side's breach of promises and backtracking, a long-standing issue in Washington. In an editorial, the South China Morning Post stated that the latest escalation in Sino-U.S. tensions can be compared to the tariff war initiated by the U.S. in April this year, describing it as ""a new round of tit-for-tat measures triggered by new U.S. technology restrictions."" The article warns that tariffs may not rise as high as before, but the real damage lies in Beijing perceiving Washington as no longer reliable and finding it harder to trust its commitments. CNN also described this new round of friction between China and the U.S. as ""déjà vu,"" noting that it is reminiscent of the scenario in June when, after reaching a consensus through talks in Geneva, the U.S. side launched a series of ""bombshells,"" leading to a decline in bilateral relations."
"During this period, Washington has been sending out seemingly contradictory signals. On one hand, it declares that if China does not yield, it will ""suffer the greatest blow."" On the other hand, it hints at ""hoping to cooperate with China,"" stating that ""much depends on the actions of the Chinese."" It appears that some American politicians envision ""cooperation"" as Washington enjoying a free feast at the table while China foots the bill and even makes sacrifices, allowing the U.S. to take whatever it wants and clean up the mess it leaves behind. Today, some American politicians are shocked, surprised, and even annoyed by China's reasonable and legitimate countermeasures, largely because this fantasy has been shattered by the reality of China treating the U.S. more equally."
"The U.S. has overestimated the effectiveness of its own bargaining chips while underestimating China's ability to counteract and its strategic resolve. This cognitive misjudgment has directly led to severe repercussions. After the U.S. once again threatened to significantly increase tariffs on China, the U.S. stock and currency markets responded with a decline, triggering global market panic and casting a shadow over the world economy. Its reckless actions in areas such as shipping and export controls have not only severely damaged China's legitimate rights and interests but also seriously disrupted international trade, economic, and maritime order, undermining the safety and stability of global production and supply chains. China's ""tit-for-tat"" response is not only to defend its own legitimate rights but also to uphold international fairness and justice."
"Please translate the following Chinese content into English: Many people have noticed that since the beginning of this year, every round of extortion initiated by the U.S. against China has hit a brick wall. Unilateral bullying will inevitably lead to China's firm and precise countermeasures. This ""give and take"" has formed a clear logic: whoever initiates unreasonable suppression must bear the corresponding consequences. As the South China Morning Post stated, the U.S.'s inconsistency and usual tactics do not work on China. Beijing's stance remains consistent—any negotiation must be based on mutual respect and trust. We certainly hope Washington will take the initiative to promptly correct its erroneous practices, but if it continues to exert maximum pressure, fabricate issues, and renege on agreements, it is destined to face the pain of hitting a brick wall repeatedly. Washington should form a highly clear expectation of behavior in this regard."
"Over the past five months, the China-U.S. economic and trade teams have held four rounds of talks, reaching important consensus, stabilizing bilateral economic and trade relations, and bringing stable expectations to the global market. This process has fully demonstrated that China and the U.S. can find ways to solve problems based on mutual respect and equal consultation. Reflecting on the experiences and lessons of the past few months, Washington should recognize the following points: First, the U.S. must respect China's legitimate development interests, which naturally include industrial upgrading and technological development. Second, China's progress does not necessarily mean that U.S. interests will be harmed. While there is competition between the two countries in certain areas, the shared benefits are far greater. Third, China and the U.S. can fully negotiate on issues of mutual concern, but the outcome must be win-win; there cannot be a realistic solution where the U.S. wins completely and China loses completely. Fourth, China does not respond to pressure and blackmail; the big stick in Washington's hand is nothing more than a paper tiger to the Chinese people."
"The Chinese side has repeatedly emphasized that there are no winners in a tariff war or a trade war. Equality, respect, and reciprocity are the only ways to properly resolve differences. China does not wish to engage in such conflicts, but it will not stand by and watch its own interests be harmed or international economic and trade rules and the multilateral trade system be undermined. The sooner Washington returns to the correct approach in dealing with China, the more hope there is for a warming of Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations."
