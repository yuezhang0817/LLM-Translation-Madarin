Editorial: Why Did This Interview with Ren Zhengfei Go Viral?
"On June 10, the front page of the People's Daily published an exclusive interview with Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei. When discussing the external blockade and suppression, Ren Zhengfei stated, ""Don't think about the difficulties, just do it, and move forward step by step."" He also called on the whole society to support theoretical scientific research that may take decades or even centuries to show contributions, urging strategic patience towards theoretical scientists. As a Chinese entrepreneur, Ren Zhengfei's confidence in ""steadfastly doing our own thing,"" his perspective that ""openness will drive us to make more progress,"" and his determination to adhere to long-termism by anchoring at the forefront of technological development have resonated widely with society."
"It is well known that Huawei has long been subjected to sanctions and suppression by the United States and some other Western countries, from chips to 5G technology. Recently, Huawei's Ascend chips were also unjustifiably ""warned"" by the United States about usage risks. However, Huawei has been ""moving forward step by step,"" overcoming one difficulty after another. This reflects a growing value consensus in Chinese society, where progress in the semiconductor field, once a bottleneck, as well as in artificial intelligence, basic research, and other highly competitive technological frontiers, is not driven by momentary passion but by long-term commitment to set goals. It is by persisting in doing ""difficult but right things"" that Huawei has gained the confidence to withstand suppression and blockades while still ""surviving,"" and has managed to break through in critical areas such as chips and operating systems. This is also a vivid demonstration of the principle of ""steadfastly managing our own affairs well."""
"""The more open a country is, the more it will drive our progress."" It should be noted that in the current environment, the growth and expansion of private enterprises like Huawei are inseparable from the support of China's vast and comprehensive industrial system, infrastructure, talent supply, and institutional guarantees, as well as the construction of a market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized business environment. Over the past seven years, the central government has held two symposiums for private enterprises to help them overcome difficulties, boost confidence, and outline development plans. Last month, the ""Law on the Promotion of Private Economy of the People's Republic of China"" officially came into effect. With 9 chapters and 78 articles, it continuously optimizes the development environment for the private economy across various levels such as fairness, regulation, service, and protection, achieving many ""firsts."" The commitment to ""two unwavering principles"" has been enshrined in law and repeatedly emphasized in party documents, providing long-term institutional confidence to private enterprises and entrepreneurs. The synergy between national top-level design and the needs of enterprise development is the most solid support for overcoming blockades and resisting risks."
"The increasing emphasis on R&D investment from various sectors of society over the years reflects a strong societal consensus on ""steadfastly managing our own affairs well."" According to a report released by Huawei's official website in April this year, Huawei's R&D investment for 2024 is set at 179.7 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 9.1%, accounting for 20.8% of its sales revenue. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics indicates that in 2024, the total R&D expenditure across the whole of society in China will exceed 3.6 trillion yuan, reaching 3.613 trillion yuan, an increase of 8.3% from the previous year, maintaining its position as the second largest in the world. China's R&D intensity has reached 2.68%, ranking 12th among major countries worldwide, surpassing the EU's average level of 2.11% and further approaching the OECD countries' average level of 2.73%. The World Intellectual Property Organization recently released the ""Global Innovation Index Report 2024,"" which shows that China's global innovation ranking has risen by one place to 11th compared to last year, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in terms of innovation over the past decade."
"Many Western media outlets, including Reuters and Bloomberg, have focused on this exclusive interview within the context of U.S.-China competition and the ongoing U.S.-China economic and trade negotiations. Such an observation is not surprising, but it somewhat narrows the developmental logic of China. Looking solely at the recent achievements of Chinese enterprises, from DeepSeek to Xiaomi's Xuanjie chip and Huawei's ""pureblood"" HarmonyOS computer, whether it is breakthroughs in key technologies or cluster innovations across multiple fields, it ultimately reflects the combined effect of national strategy and market principles. This makes societal operations more efficient, industries more dynamic, and people's lives more convenient. This is determined by China's national conditions and system. Ren Zhengfei's statement that ""one of the purposes of socialism is to develop society"" embodies this simple logic. This is also the source of China's resilience and confidence in addressing various risks and challenges."
"""The new era and new journey present vast and promising prospects for the development of the private economy. It is an opportune time for private enterprises and entrepreneurs to showcase their talents."" In his important speech at the symposium with private enterprises, General Secretary Xi Jinping expressed high expectations for private enterprises. As a representative of private entrepreneurs, Ren Zhengfei's statement, ""Don't think about the difficulties, just do it,"" went viral, reflecting the collective admiration of countless Chinese people for the spirit of ""those who dare to fight will win"" and their firm confidence in securing a future through hard work. Today's China not only needs to ""do,"" but to do so with determination, endurance, and direction. In a world full of uncertainties, this long-term commitment to practical action and the spirit of perseverance is the foundation of China's confidence in weathering storms and achieving rejuvenation."
