"Editorial: From Xi'an to Astana, China-Central Asia Cooperation Steadily Advances Forward"
"At the invitation of President Tokayev of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the second China-Central Asia Summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, from June 16 to 18. During the summit, he exchanged views with leaders of Central Asian countries on the achievements of the China-Central Asia mechanism, mutually beneficial cooperation within the framework, and international and regional hotspot issues, providing top-level design for the development of relations between China and the five Central Asian countries. This is the first time the China-Central Asia Summit is held in a Central Asian country, marking the beginning of a ""golden era of regional cooperation"" and becoming ""another milestone in cooperation between China and Central Asian countries."" The high praise from Central Asian media fully demonstrates the sincere expectations of regional countries for the summit to promote the building of a China-Central Asia community with a shared future."
"The relationship between China and Central Asian countries has deep historical roots, broad practical needs, and a solid foundation of public support. In May 2023, the first China-Central Asia Summit was held in Xi'an, marking the official launch of the China-Central Asia mechanism and ushering in a new phase for relations between China and Central Asian countries. At the Xi'an Summit, President Xi Jinping proposed ""four principles"" for building a China-Central Asia community with a shared future and put forward ""eight suggestions"" for developing cooperation between China and Central Asian countries, providing direction and pathways for the development of China-Central Asia relations. Spanning over 3,000 kilometers from Xi'an to Astana, this axis of cooperation not only carries the deep friendship of the ancient Silk Road but also injects invaluable certainty into a world of turbulence and change, becoming a model of solidarity and collaboration for countries in the Global South."
"China and Central Asian countries are companions on the path to modernization. Since President Xi Jinping proposed the ""Silk Road Economic Belt"" initiative in Kazakhstan in September 2013, Central Asia has become one of the regions with the most projects implemented within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative. The cooperation between the two sides is characterized by both ""quantity"" and ""quality."" In the first five months of this year, China's import and export with the five Central Asian countries reached 286.42 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 10.4%, setting a record high for the same period. The Central Asia natural gas pipeline has delivered over 500 billion cubic meters of natural gas to China. The China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway under construction will provide Kyrgyzstan with its first access to the sea. The China-Europe freight trains passing through Central Asia have built bridges of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. From Confucius Institutes and Luban Workshops, a large number of talents familiar with cross-cultural communication and emerging engineering technologies have emerged. This ""two-way journey"" between China and Central Asian countries is not just a growth curve on a data report but also the smiles on the faces of the people, giving the words ""cooperation and win-win"" a tangible warmth."
"""Facing global challenges such as unilateralism and protectionism, China and Central Asian countries are confidently demonstrating a model of mutual respect, sustainable development, and win-win cooperation,"" as accurately summarized by Central Asian media, encapsulating the core values of cooperation between China and Central Asian countries. Over the past thirty-plus years since establishing diplomatic relations, China and Central Asian countries have consistently adhered to the principles of mutual respect, good-neighborliness, solidarity, and mutual benefit, setting an example of a new type of international relations. With the formation of the ""three coverages"" pattern—comprehensive strategic partnership coverage, full coverage of signed cooperation documents for the Belt and Road Initiative, and comprehensive practice of the community with a shared future for mankind at the bilateral level—alongside the implementation and fruition of the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative, the vibrant vitality nurtured by the cooperation between China and Central Asian countries in fostering good-neighborliness, security, and prosperity is propelling the region into a hopeful land of mutual benefit and harmonious coexistence."
"China and Central Asian countries, both part of the Global South, are committed to practicing genuine multilateralism. Within multilateral frameworks such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia, China closely collaborates with Central Asian countries. Together, they staunchly defend multilateralism, firmly support each other on issues concerning their core interests, and stand up for each other at critical moments to uphold their legitimate rights and strategic interests. This cooperation has promoted the democratization of international relations and pushed the international order towards a more just and equitable direction."
"There is a Kazakh proverb: ""Where there is unity, happiness will surely follow."" As the leaders of the six countries shake hands again in Astana, the second China-Central Asia Summit is bound to become an event that further consolidates consensus, deepens cooperation, and promotes the building of a closer China-Central Asia community with a shared future. As good neighbors, good partners, good friends, and good brothers, China and the Central Asian countries will use greater wisdom and responsibility to elevate China-Central Asia relations to a new level, making new and greater contributions to regional and even global peace, stability, and prosperity."
