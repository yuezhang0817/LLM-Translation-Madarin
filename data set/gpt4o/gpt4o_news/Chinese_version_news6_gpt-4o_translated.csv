"Editorial: The World Has Never Been More Eager to Understand ""Why China"""
"On October 14th, the Second World Conference on Sinology opened in Shanghai. This year's conference, themed ""Historical and Contemporary China from a Global Perspective,"" brings together approximately 500 guests from over 50 countries and regions to discuss China's history, present, and future. In today's world, where the process of economic globalization faces headwinds and dialogue among civilizations encounters challenges, the international community's attention to China is increasing day by day. China's international influence, appeal, and shaping power are also continuously strengthening, and the world has never been more eager to understand China."
"In 2023, President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the World Conference on Sinology · Shanghai Forum, stating that ""Sinology is the study of historical China as well as contemporary China."" This statement elucidates the profound significance of Sinology, providing important guidance for promoting exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations and fostering the prosperity and development of global Sinology. This year's conference features a main forum and five parallel sub-forums, covering multiple key dimensions of Sinology research. It academically bridges historical and contemporary China, reflecting a holistic civilizational perspective, and conveys to the world the awareness and efforts of China in the new era to construct a subjective knowledge system."
"The rise of Chinese Studies globally reflects a profound change in the world's need and approach to understanding China. Traditional Sinology primarily focused on historical China, with literature and ancient civilization as its main research subjects. In contrast, Chinese Studies expands the research scope from ""historical China"" to ""contemporary China,"" shifts from ""the China of texts"" to ""the China of practice,"" and transforms from ""the other’s China"" to ""the subject’s China."" This transformation is underpinned by the historical changes in the relationship between China and the world. Today, China is not only an object of academic research but also a pathway and method to modernization. Amidst profound global adjustments, China has become a country with ""magnetic appeal."" The rise of Chinese Studies is a significant marker of the world's renewed discovery, understanding, and emulation of China. This discovery and understanding are no longer confined to an ""Orientalist"" gaze but are based on a civilizational exchange through equal dialogue."
"Throughout history, any global power has needed to establish its own subjectivity studies to guide its understanding of the external world. Looking back at world history, Western Europe, Russia, the United States, and others all developed their own knowledge systems and constructed their subjectivity during their rise in modern times. For example, American studies began to develop during World War II and matured by the 1960s, marked by the emergence of modernization theory. With modernization theory as a hallmark, the United States gained a theoretical framework for self-awareness and expression, which served as the foundation for constructing its own knowledge system."
"The subjectivity of Chinese civilization lies in the fact that China's development experience cannot be simply summarized using existing Western theoretical frameworks. To truly understand China, one must deeply grasp the unique genes of Chinese civilization. Historian Arnold Toynbee once lamented that among the more than 20 forms of civilization that have emerged in nearly 6,000 years of human history, only Chinese culture has continued to this day without interruption. General Secretary Xi Jinping has profoundly elucidated and summarized the five prominent characteristics of Chinese civilization—continuity, innovation, unity, inclusiveness, and peace. These interrelated traits are both the key to understanding China and the foundation of China's confidence. The practice of the Chinese path to modernization demonstrates that modernization does not equate to Westernization, and that the diversity of civilizations is the fundamental form of human development. Only by breaking free from the constraints of a single narrative can we truly understand the constructive significance of China to the world from a diverse perspective."
"World Sinology, as a comprehensive discipline that transcends traditional Sinology and regional Chinese studies, holds its core value in reconstructing the global cognitive framework of China. This expansion of the discipline has significant practical implications: within the knowledge production system dominated by Western centrism, biased perceptions have historically led to severe misunderstandings—such as the enactment of the Chinese Exclusion Act in the United States in the 19th century, which was directly related to the distorted dissemination of knowledge about China. Today, World Sinology, through interdisciplinary approaches and a global perspective, provides the international community with an objective framework for understanding China, gradually dispelling the cognitive biases brought about by the old ""hegemony-knowledge"" structure."
"As a practice of dialogue between civilizations, the World Conference on Sinology itself is a vivid embodiment of the exchange and mutual learning among civilizations. The continued hosting of the conference demonstrates China's determination to integrate into the world with a more open and confident stance and to participate in the construction of the global knowledge system. At the critical crossroads of human development, the spirit of open and inclusive dialogue embodied in the conference is particularly valuable. Chinese-style modernization has created a new form of human civilization and is expanding the vast space for the development and progress of human civilization with this new form."
