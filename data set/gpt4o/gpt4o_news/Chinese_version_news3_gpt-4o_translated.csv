"Editorial: Military Force Cannot Bring Peace to the Middle East, a Consensus of the International Community"
"On the 16th, the conflict between Israel and Iran entered its fourth day, with both sides escalating the intensity of their confrontation in a cycle of ""an eye for an eye."" The mutual attacks have not only resulted in casualties and damage to facilities but have also set a dangerous precedent by targeting nuclear and energy facilities. This has sparked deep concerns in the international community about the situation spiraling out of control."
"Israel and Iran are both important countries in the Middle East, and their relations significantly impact the region's overall peace and conflict dynamics. The urgent task at hand is to immediately take measures to prevent the escalation of conflict and avoid plunging the region into greater turmoil, returning to the path of resolving issues through diplomatic means. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has held phone conversations with the foreign ministers of Iran and Israel, urging both sides to resolve their differences through dialogue. All relevant parties should immediately take steps to brake the escalation of conflict and cool down the tensions. Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom have also expressed their willingness to mediate. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres wrote on social media: ""Israel's bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities and Iran's missile attacks on Tel Aviv have escalated enough. It's time to stop. Peace and diplomacy must prevail."""
"It is crucial to fully recognize that adhering to the concept of common security is essential to thoroughly addressing the legitimate concerns of all parties. Why is it said that maximum pressure and preemptive strikes are unfeasible? The convoluted history of the Iran nuclear issue itself proves this point. On the surface, the conflict arises due to ""nuclear"" issues, but fundamentally, it is yet another manifestation of a security dilemma. Israel, fearing that Iran's development of nuclear weapons threatens its security, adopted a ""preemptive"" strategy. However, its actions that infringe upon Iran's sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity, in turn, lead to greater insecurity for itself. In fact, the closest moment to resolving the Iran nuclear issue was not achieved through ""preemptive"" strikes, but rather through a 13-year ""marathon"" negotiation, with the greatest possible international cooperation, culminating in a binding comprehensive agreement in 2015. If it weren't for the subsequent ""breach of agreement"" by the United States, and if the agreement had been earnestly and fully implemented, both Iran and Israel would undoubtedly be much safer than they are now."
"The ancient Roman scholar Cicero once pointed out, ""The vast majority of people believe that what is gained from war is more valuable than what is obtained in a peaceful environment, but this is actually a mistake."" The late former President of Israel, Shimon Peres, expressed a similar view: ""True victory is harvesting peace, not sowing the seeds of another war."" The Middle East has witnessed numerous military conflicts throughout its history, which have not resolved disputes but rather laid the groundwork for more conflicts. The vicious cycle of violence and confrontation has deepened the rifts between countries in the region, making the path to peacefully resolving disputes increasingly difficult. To escape the predicament of bloodshed and turmoil, the Middle East must first abandon the outdated mindset of ""beggar-thy-neighbor"" and advocate for a new security concept that is common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable. It should be recognized that despite differing positions and ideologies, there are still common interests in Middle Eastern security affairs. Only through dialogue, rather than confrontation, can differences and oppositions be narrowed, and the greatest common ground for cooperation be found."
"As a country with special influence over Israel, the United States, in particular, should bear the responsibility of a major power in its words and actions. For a long time, the general impression has been that while the U.S. finds it difficult to play a constructive role in alleviating regional conflicts, it excels at causing disruption. The persistent conflicts in the Middle East are not unrelated to the ""visible hand"" of external powers. Many analyses suggest that the U.S. attempt to force Iran into submission through ""maximum pressure"" tactics is a significant factor in the sudden escalation of the Israeli-Iranian situation. In an editorial, Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao stated that Washington had given Iran 60 days to reach a nuclear disarmament agreement, and Israel launched an attack precisely on the 61st day, ""demonstrating a diplomatic tacit understanding of playing good cop, bad cop."" An article in The New York Times last year compared the U.S. to a lion, the ""king of the Middle Eastern jungle,"" and Iran to a ""parasitic wasp,"" advocating that to ""kill the parasitic wasp,"" the U.S. needs to ""burn down the entire jungle."" This kind of thinking is extremely dangerous."
"The security concerns of Middle Eastern countries need to be addressed, and military force cannot bring peace to the Middle East. This is a common consensus in the international community, including China. Currently, diplomatic means regarding the Iranian nuclear issue have not been exhausted, and there is still hope for a peaceful resolution. The most important thing is for the conflicting parties and relevant parties to immediately take measures to create conditions for returning to the track of dialogue and negotiation to resolve the issue."
