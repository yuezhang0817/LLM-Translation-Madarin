"It so happened that when Yu Village turned around to look, it was not someone else but Zhang Rugu, who had been dismissed from office in the same case as him in the past. Zhang was originally from this area and had been living at home since his dismissal. Upon hearing the news that the capital had approved the reinstatement of former officials, he began to seek connections and opportunities. Suddenly encountering Yu Village, he hurriedly offered his congratulations. After exchanging greetings, Zhang Rugu shared the news with Yu Village, who was naturally delighted. They quickly exchanged a few words and then parted ways to return to their respective homes. Leng Zixing, upon hearing this, promptly offered a suggestion, advising Yu Village to ask Lin Ruhai to intercede with Jia Zheng in the capital. Yu Village understood his intention, bid farewell, and returned to his residence, where he quickly sought out the official gazette to verify the news."
"The next day, when they met, Lin Ruhai said, ""By a fortunate coincidence, due to the passing of my humble wife, my mother-in-law in the capital, concerned that my young daughter has no one to rely on for education, has already sent boats to fetch her. However, as my daughter has not fully recovered, she has not yet departed. At this moment, I am contemplating how to repay the kindness of your instruction, and this opportunity presents itself. How could I not wholeheartedly seek to repay you? Please rest assured. I have already made arrangements and prepared a letter of recommendation, entrusting my brother-in-law to assist you thoroughly, so that I may somewhat express my humble sincerity. As for any expenses, I have clearly stated them in my letter to my brother-in-law, so you need not worry about it."" Yu Cun bowed repeatedly, expressing his gratitude, and then asked, ""May I know what position your esteemed relatives hold? I fear that I might be too presumptuous to enter the capital abruptly."" Lin Ruhai smiled and replied, ""If we speak of my relatives, they share the same lineage as you. They are the grandsons of Lord Rong. My eldest brother-in-law currently holds the title of First-Class General, named She, with the courtesy name Enhou; my second brother-in-law is named Zheng, with the courtesy name Cunzhu, currently serving as an Assistant Minister in the Ministry of Works. He is a humble and virtuous person, greatly embodying the legacy of his grandfather, not one of those frivolous and superficial officials. That is why I have written to trouble him. Otherwise, not only would it tarnish your integrity, but I would also disdain to do so."" Hearing this, Yu Cun finally believed what Zixing had said the previous day, and he thanked Lin Ruhai again. Lin Ruhai then said, ""I have chosen the second day of the next month for my daughter to enter the capital. Wouldn't it be convenient for you to travel together?"" Yu Cun obediently agreed, feeling very pleased in his heart. Lin Ruhai then prepared gifts and a farewell banquet, which Yu Cun accepted one by one."
"The female student, Daiyu, had just recovered and was originally reluctant to leave her father. However, her grandmother insisted that she must go, and Jia Yuanchun also said, ""Your father is nearly fifty and has no intention of remarrying. Moreover, you are often ill and very young, with no mother to guide you and no siblings to support you. Now, by staying with your grandmother and your uncles and cousins, it will ease my worries. Why do you refuse to go?"" Hearing this, Daiyu wept as she bid farewell, and then she boarded the boat with her nurse and several elderly women from the Rong Mansion. Yuanchun had another boat, accompanied by two young servants, following Daiyu."
"Upon arriving in the capital, Yu Cun first tidied up his attire, took a young attendant with him, and carried the name card of his nephew to present at the gate of the Rong Mansion. At that time, Jia Zheng had already read the letter from his brother-in-law, so he promptly invited Yu Cun in for a meeting. Seeing that Yu Cun had a commanding appearance and spoke eloquently, and considering that Jia Zheng greatly admired scholars, respected the virtuous, and helped the weak, much like his ancestors, he treated Yu Cun with special regard, especially since he came with his brother-in-law's recommendation. Jia Zheng went out of his way to assist Yu Cun. On the day of the petition, Yu Cun was quietly arranged to resume his position while awaiting a vacancy. Within less than two months, a vacancy arose in the Jinling Ying Tian Prefecture, and Yu Cun was appointed to fill it. After bidding farewell to Jia Zheng, he chose an auspicious day to assume his new post. This is not the main focus of the story."
"Upon disembarking from the boat that day, Daiyu found that a sedan chair and a cart for her luggage, sent by the Rongguo Mansion, had been waiting for her. Lin Daiyu had often heard her mother mention that her grandmother's family was different from others. The few third-class maidservants she had recently encountered already displayed an extraordinary level of living in terms of food, clothing, and daily necessities, let alone the family itself. Therefore, she was cautious with every step and attentive at all times, unwilling to speak a word too many or take an extra step, fearing that she might be ridiculed."
"Upon entering the sedan chair and arriving in the city, she glanced outside through the gauze window. The bustling streets and the dense population were distinctly different from other places. After traveling for half a day, she suddenly saw two large stone lions squatting on the north side of the street, with a grand three-bay gate adorned with beast heads. In front of the gate sat about a dozen people dressed in splendid attire. The main gate was not open; only the side gates to the east and west had people coming and going. Above the main gate hung a plaque with the words ""Imperially Constructed Ningguo Mansion"" inscribed in large characters. Daiyu thought, ""This must be the main house of my maternal grandfather."" With this in mind, she continued westward. Not far away, there was another similar three-bay gate, which was the Rongguo Mansion. However, they did not enter through the main gate but through the west side gate. The sedan chair bearers carried her inside, traveling a short distance before setting it down and leaving. The women who had followed behind had already dismounted from their sedan chairs and caught up. Three or four well-dressed young lads, about seventeen or eighteen years old, came forward to lift the sedan chair again. The women walked alongside, accompanying them to a flower-hung gate where they set the chair down. The young lads withdrew, and the women came forward to lift the sedan chair curtain and help Daiyu out. Lin Daiyu, holding onto the hand of one of the women, entered through the flower-hung gate. On either side were winding corridors, and in the middle was a passage hall, where a large marble screen on a rosewood stand was placed. Passing the screen, there was a small three-bay hall, and behind it was the main courtyard of the rear house. The main building had five rooms with carved beams and painted rafters. On either side were corridors and side rooms, with various birds like parrots and thrushes hanging. On the terrace sat several maids dressed in red and green, who, upon seeing them arrive, quickly smiled and came forward, saying, ""The old lady was just thinking of you, and here you are."" Meanwhile, three or four of them vied to lift the curtain, and someone announced, ""Miss Lin has arrived."""
"When Daiyu first entered the room, she saw two people supporting an elderly woman with hair as white as silver coming towards her. Daiyu immediately knew it was her grandmother. Just as she was about to pay her respects, her grandmother pulled her into her arms, calling her ""my dear heart"" and began to cry bitterly. Everyone standing around couldn't help but cover their faces and weep, and Daiyu also couldn't stop crying. After a while, the others slowly managed to calm them down, and Daiyu finally paid her respects to her grandmother. This was the Lady Dowager Shi mentioned by Leng Zixing, the mother of Jia She and Jia Zheng. Then the Lady Dowager introduced them to Daiyu one by one: ""This is your eldest aunt; this is your second aunt; this is your late cousin Zhu's wife, Sister-in-law Zhu."" Daiyu greeted each of them in turn. The Lady Dowager then said, ""Call the young ladies over. Since we have a guest from afar today, they can skip their lessons."" With that, two people left to carry out her orders."
"Before long, three nursemaids and five or six maidservants arrived, surrounding three sisters. The first sister had a slightly plump figure and a well-proportioned body, with cheeks like fresh lychees and a nose as smooth as goose fat. She was gentle and silent, making her very approachable. The second sister had sloping shoulders and a slender waist, with a tall and slim figure, an oval face, bright eyes, and well-shaped eyebrows. Her gaze was lively and spirited, with an aura of elegance and brilliance that made one forget the mundane upon seeing her. The third sister was not yet fully grown, with a youthful appearance. All three wore the same style of hairpins, earrings, skirts, and jackets. Daiyu quickly stood up to greet them, exchanging pleasantries and introductions before everyone took their seats. The maidservants served tea, and they talked about how Daiyu's mother fell ill, how she sought medical treatment, and how her funeral was arranged. Inevitably, Grandmother Jia became emotional and said, ""Among all my children, I cherished your mother the most. Now she has left me so suddenly, without even a final farewell. Seeing you now, how can I not feel heartbroken?"" As she spoke, she held Daiyu in her arms and began to sob. Everyone hurried to comfort and console her, and she gradually calmed down."
"The group observed that although Daiyu was young in age, her demeanor and conversation were refined. Despite her frail and delicate appearance, she possessed a natural elegance, indicating that she had a chronic condition. They asked, ""What medicine do you usually take, and why not seek urgent treatment?"" Daiyu replied, ""I have been like this since childhood. From the time I could eat solid food, I have been taking medicine, and to this day, I have not stopped. Many renowned doctors have been consulted to prescribe and prepare medicine, but none have been effective. When I was three years old, I heard that a bald monk came and said he wanted to take me away to become a nun. My parents, of course, did not agree. He then said, 'If you can't bear to part with her, I'm afraid her illness will never be cured in her lifetime. If you want her to be well, she must never hear the sound of crying; apart from her parents, she must not see any relatives or friends with different surnames, only then can she live peacefully.' His words were dismissed as nonsense, and no one paid him any heed. Now, I am still taking Ginseng Yangrong Pills."" Grandmother Jia said, ""That's perfect, I am currently having some pills prepared here. I will have them make an extra batch."""
"Before the words were finished, laughter was heard from the backyard, and someone said, ""I am late and did not come to greet the distant guest!"" Daiyu wondered, ""Everyone here is so quiet and respectful, who is this person arriving so boldly and rudely?"" As she pondered, she saw a group of maids and servant women surrounding someone entering from the back room. This person was dressed differently from the other girls: her colorful and embroidered attire was dazzling, resembling a goddess or fairy. She wore a gold-threaded hairpin adorned with pearls, a morning sun five-phoenix hairpin with hanging beads; around her neck was a gold necklace with a dragon pattern; at her waist was a bean-green palace sash with a double-sided rose pendant; she wore a narrow-sleeved jacket of red satin embroidered with golden butterflies among flowers, overlaid with a multicolored silk jacket of stone blue and silver mink; her skirt was a jade green floral crepe. She had almond-shaped eyes and arched eyebrows, a slender figure, and an elegant demeanor. Her face was radiant with a subtle authority, and her lips seemed to smile even before she spoke. Daiyu quickly stood up to greet her. Grandmother Jia laughed and said, ""You don't know her; she is famously unruly here, what we call a 'spicy character' in the southern provinces. You can just call her 'Phoenix Spicy'."""
"Daiyu was unsure how to address her, but saw that all the sisters were quickly telling her, ""This is Sister-in-law Lian."" Although Daiyu did not know her, she had heard her mother mention that her eldest uncle Jia She’s son, Jia Lian, was married to the niece of her second aunt, Lady Wang. This niece, Wang Xifeng, had been raised as a boy from a young age. Daiyu hurriedly smiled and greeted her, addressing her as ""sister-in-law."""
"Lady Wang took Daiyu's hand and carefully looked her over from head to toe before leading her to sit next to Grandmother Jia. She then smiled and said, ""I have never seen such a beautiful person until today! And with such an air of elegance, she doesn't seem like the granddaughter from an outside family, but rather a direct granddaughter. No wonder Grandmother thinks of her all the time. It's such a pity that my poor sister has had such a hard life, especially with her mother passing away!"" As she spoke, she wiped her tears with a handkerchief. Grandmother Jia laughed and said, ""I just got better, and now you're trying to upset me. Your sister just arrived from a long journey, and she's weak. I just managed to calm her down, so let's not bring up sad topics."" Upon hearing this, Lady Wang quickly turned her sadness into joy and said, ""That's right! As soon as I saw my sister, my heart was all for her, filled with both joy and sorrow, and I forgot about Grandmother. I deserve a scolding!"" She then hurriedly took Daiyu's hand again and asked, ""How old are you, sister? Have you been to school? What medicine are you currently taking? Don't feel homesick here. If you want anything to eat or play with, just let me know. If the maids or servants aren't treating you well, tell me too."" She also asked the maids, ""Have Miss Lin's luggage and belongings been brought in? How many people came with her? Make sure to clean up two rooms quickly so they can rest."""
"While speaking, the tea and snacks had already been served. Xifeng personally served the tea and snacks. She then saw her second aunt asking her, ""Have the monthly allowances been distributed?"" Xifeng replied, ""The monthly allowances have been fully distributed. I just took some people to the back building to look for satin, and after searching for half a day, we didn't find what Madam mentioned yesterday. Perhaps Madam remembered incorrectly?"" Lady Wang said, ""Whether it's there or not, it doesn't matter."" She then added, ""You should have taken out a couple of pieces for your younger sister to make clothes. Remember to send someone to get them later tonight, and don't forget."" Xifeng said, ""I had anticipated this. Knowing that my younger sister would arrive in the next couple of days, I have already prepared them. I'll send them over after Madam has reviewed them."" Lady Wang smiled, nodded, and said nothing further."
"The tea and snacks had been cleared away, and Grandmother Jia instructed two old maids to take Daiyu to meet her two uncles. At that moment, Jia She’s wife, Lady Xing, quickly stood up and said with a smile, ""I’ll take my niece over, it’s convenient."" Grandmother Jia laughed and said, ""Exactly, you go ahead, no need to come back."" Lady Xing replied with an ""Alright,"" and then took Daiyu to bid farewell to Lady Wang. Everyone escorted them to the front of the passageway."
"Exiting the hanging flower gate, a group of young servants had already brought over a green-canopied carriage. Lady Xing took Daiyu and sat on it. The older women lowered the carriage curtain and instructed the young servants to lift it. They pulled it to a wider area, harnessed the tame mules, and exited through the west corner gate. They passed the main gate of the Rong Mansion to the east and entered a large black-oiled gate, stopping in front of the ceremonial gate before getting down. The young servants withdrew, lifted the carriage curtain, and Lady Xing, holding Daiyu's hand, entered the courtyard.

Daiyu observed the houses and courtyards, realizing they must be part of the garden partitioned from the Rong Mansion. Entering through the three-layered ceremonial gates, she indeed saw that the main rooms, side rooms, and corridors were all exquisitely delicate, unlike the grand and majestic structures she had seen earlier. Moreover, the trees and rocks were scattered throughout the courtyard.

As they entered the main room, many beautifully dressed concubines and maids came to greet them. Lady Xing invited Daiyu to sit and sent someone to the study outside to invite Jia She. After a while, someone returned with a message: ""The master said, 'I have not been feeling well these past days, and seeing the young lady would only bring mutual sorrow, so I cannot bear to meet her just yet. I advise the young lady not to be sad or homesick. Stay with the Old Lady and your aunt, and it will be just like home. Although the sisters may be clumsy, being together can relieve some of the boredom. If there is any grievance, feel free to speak up, and don't treat us as outsiders.'""

Daiyu quickly stood up and listened attentively. After sitting for a moment longer, she took her leave."
"Mrs. Xing earnestly invited her to stay for dinner, but Daiyu smiled and replied, ""Aunt, I truly appreciate your kindness in offering me a meal, and I should not refuse. However, I must go to pay my respects to my second uncle. I fear that if I accept your offer and leave late, it would be disrespectful. I can accept your hospitality another day. I hope you understand."" Mrs. Xing, hearing this, smiled and said, ""That makes sense."" She then instructed two or three maids to carefully escort the young lady using the same carriage. Daiyu then took her leave. Mrs. Xing accompanied her to the front gate, gave a few more instructions to the attendants, and only returned after watching the carriage depart."
"Lin Daiyu entered the Rong Mansion and got out of the carriage. She was led by several old women, turning east, passing through an east-west corridor, and heading south to a large courtyard inside the ceremonial gate. In front of her were five main rooms, with side rooms and auxiliary rooms on both sides, all interconnected and grand, different from Lady Jia's place. Daiyu realized that this was the main inner chamber, with a main path leading directly to the main gate. Upon entering the main hall, she first saw a large plaque with a blue background and nine golden dragons, inscribed with three large characters: ""Rongxi Hall."" Below were smaller characters: ""On such-and-such date, presented to Duke Rongguo, Jia Yuan,"" along with ""The Treasure of the Imperial Brush."" On a large purple sandalwood table carved with dragons, there was a three-foot-tall ancient bronze tripod with a green patina, and hanging above was a large painting of a black dragon. On one side was a golden incense burner, and on the other was a glass ornament. On the floor were two rows of sixteen nanmu armchairs, and there was a couplet on an ebony plaque with silver-inlaid characters, which read:"
"""Jewels on the seat shine like the sun and moon, while the patterns in front of the hall glow like clouds and mist."""
"The following line in small characters reads: ""Written by fellow townsman and lifelong educator, Di Xun, inheritor of the title of Duke of Dong'an, Mu Shi, with respectful regards."""
"Madam Wang often sat and rested not in the main room, but in the three side rooms to the east of the main room. Therefore, the old maid led Daiyu into the eastern room. On the large kang bed by the window, there was a spread of crimson foreign felt, with a large red brocade pillow with gold coin patterns at the head, a stone blue brocade pillow with gold coin patterns, and a large autumn fragrance-colored brocade quilt with gold coin patterns. On either side, there was a pair of small plum blossom-shaped lacquer tables. On the table to the left were a King Wen ding-shaped incense box and spoon and chopsticks; on the table to the right was a Ru kiln vase—inside which were fresh flowers, along with tea bowls, spittoons, and other items. Below, facing west, there were four chairs in a row, all covered with silver-red floral chair covers, with four footrests underneath. On either side of the chairs, there was also a pair of tall tables, fully equipped with tea bowls and vases with flowers. The rest of the furnishings need not be described in detail."
"The elderly women invited Daiyu to sit on the kang (a traditional heated brick bed), but there were two brocade cushions placed opposite each other on the edge of the kang. Assessing the seating arrangement, Daiyu chose not to sit on the kang and instead sat on a chair to the east. The maids in the room quickly brought her some tea. As Daiyu sipped her tea, she observed the maids' attire and demeanor, noting that they were indeed different from those in other households. Before she finished her tea, a maid dressed in a red silk jacket and a blue satin vest with embroidered edges approached with a smile and said, ""Madam invites Miss Lin to sit over there."" Upon hearing this, the elderly women led Daiyu out again and into a small three-room suite on the east veranda."
"In the center of the kang (a heated brick bed) was a kang table, piled with books and tea sets. Against the east wall, facing west, was a half-worn blue satin backrest and cushion. Madam Wang was sitting at the lower end on the west side, also using a half-worn blue satin backrest and cushion. When she saw Daiyu coming, she moved to the east to make space. Daiyu assumed this was Jia Zheng's seat. Seeing three chairs lined up against the kang, each covered with half-worn ink-dyed chair covers, Daiyu sat on one of them. Madam Wang repeatedly invited her to sit on the kang, so she sat next to Madam Wang. Madam Wang said, ""Your uncle is fasting today, so you can meet him another time. However, he has one thing to tell you: your three sisters are all very good. In the future, whether you study, learn to read, or practice needlework together, or even occasionally play, you should always be considerate of each other. But there is one thing that worries me the most: I have a troublesome child, a 'troublemaker' in the family. Today, he went to the temple to fulfill a vow and hasn't returned yet. You'll see him in the evening. Just make sure not to pay attention to him in the future. Your sisters all avoid getting involved with him."""
"Lin Daiyu often heard her mother mention that her second aunt had a cousin who was born with a jade in his mouth. He was exceptionally mischievous, disliked studying, and loved mingling with the women in the inner quarters. Their grandmother doted on him excessively, and no one dared to discipline him. Now, hearing Lady Wang speak of him in such a way, Lin Daiyu realized she was referring to this cousin. She smiled and said, ""Aunt, are you talking about the brother who was born with a jade? At home, I often heard my mother mention that this brother is a year older than me and is nicknamed Baoyu. Although he is very mischievous, she said he has a great relationship with the sisters. Besides, now that I'm here, I will naturally only associate with the sisters. The brothers have their own separate quarters, so how could I possibly get involved with them?""

Lady Wang laughed and said, ""You don't know the reason: he is different from others. Since childhood, he has been pampered by the old lady and is accustomed to being raised with the sisters. If the sisters ignore him for a day, he becomes quieter. Even if he feels bored, he just goes out of the second gate and vents his frustration on his two little servants, and it's over after a while. But if the sisters talk to him more on any given day, he gets happy and all sorts of things happen. So I advise you not to pay attention to him. He can be sweet-talking one moment, then act as if there's no sky or sun the next, and sometimes he's just silly and foolish. Just don't believe him."""
"Daiyu responded to each one. A maid came in and said, ""The Old Madam has called for dinner."" Lady Wang quickly took Daiyu from the back room through the rear corridor to the west. Exiting through a corner gate, they entered a wide north-south alley. To the south stood a small three-room side hall, and to the north was a large painted screen wall, behind which was a side gate leading to a small room. Lady Wang smiled and pointed it out to Daiyu, saying, ""This is your cousin Feng's room. In the future, you can come here to find her. If you need anything, just tell her."" At the entrance to this courtyard, there were also four or five young boys standing by with their hands respectfully at their sides. Lady Wang then led Daiyu through an east-west passageway, which led to Grandmother Jia's rear courtyard."
"Upon entering the inner room, several people were already there waiting. When they saw Lady Wang arrive, they began to set up tables and chairs. Jia Zhu's wife, Lady Li, served the meal, Xi Feng arranged the chopsticks, and Lady Wang served the soup. Grandmother Jia sat alone on the main couch, with four empty chairs on either side. Xi Feng quickly pulled Daiyu to sit in the first chair on the left, but Daiyu modestly declined. Grandmother Jia smiled and said, ""Your aunt and sisters-in-law are not eating here. You are a guest, so you should sit here."" Only then did Daiyu thank her and take a seat. Grandmother Jia then asked Lady Wang to sit. The three sisters, Yingchun, Tanchun, and Xichun, thanked her for their seats and came forward. Yingchun sat in the first chair on the right, Tanchun in the second on the left, and Xichun in the second on the right. Nearby, maidservants held dusters, washbasins, and towels. Lady Li and Xi Feng stood by the table, offering food. Although there were many daughters-in-law and maidservants waiting outside, not a single cough was heard."
"After the meal was quietly finished, each maid brought tea on small trays. That day, Lin Ruhai taught his daughter to cherish blessings and maintain her health, saying that after a meal, one should wait for the food to be fully digested before drinking tea, to avoid harming the spleen and stomach. Now, seeing that many things here did not align with the customs of her own home, Daiyu had no choice but to adapt and change her habits accordingly, so she accepted the tea. Soon, someone brought over a rinsing bowl, and Daiyu rinsed her mouth in the same manner. After washing her hands, tea was brought again, which was the tea meant for drinking. Grandmother Jia then said, ""You may leave now, let us chat freely."" Upon hearing this, Lady Wang quickly stood up, exchanged a few more words, and then left with Fengjie and Li. Grandmother Jia then asked Daiyu what books she was reading. Daiyu replied, ""I have just started reading the 'Four Books'."" Daiyu also inquired about what books her cousins were reading. Grandmother Jia said, ""What books are they reading? They just need to recognize a few characters to avoid being completely illiterate!"""
"Before the words were finished, footsteps were heard outside, and a maid came in smiling, ""Baoyu is here!"" Daiyu was wondering in her heart, ""This Baoyu, I wonder what kind of lazy person he is, a clueless child? — It might be better not to see such a fool."" As she was thinking this, suddenly, before the maid could finish her announcement, a young gentleman had already entered:"
"Wearing a purple and gold crown inlaid with jewels, with a gold forehead band featuring two dragons playing with a pearl; dressed in a red robe with two-tone gold butterflies and flowers, with sleeves like arrows, tied with a palace sash of colorful silk with tassels, and over it, a stone-blue brocade coat with floral patterns and tassels; wearing small morning boots of blue satin with pink soles. Her face is like the moon of mid-autumn, her complexion like the flowers of a spring dawn, her sideburns are as if cut by a knife, her eyebrows like painted ink, her face like a peach blossom, and her eyes like autumn waves. Even when angry, she seems to smile; even when glaring, there is affection. Around her neck is a gold dragon necklace, along with a five-colored silk cord tied to a beautiful jade."
"When Daiyu saw him, she was greatly surprised and thought to herself, ""How strange, it seems as if I've seen him somewhere before, he looks so familiar!"" She watched as Baoyu paid his respects to Grandmother Jia, who then instructed, ""Go see your mother."" Baoyu turned and left. After a while, he returned, having changed his attire: his short hair was braided into small plaits around his head, tied with red silk, all gathered into a large braid at the crown, shiny and black as lacquer, adorned with four large pearls and a gold eight-treasure pendant; he wore a half-new silver-red floral jacket, along with a necklace, a jade pendant, a name tag lock, and an amulet; below, his pants were partially visible, made of pine-flower patterned silk, with brocade-edged socks and thick-soled bright red shoes. This made his face appear as if powdered, his lips as if painted; his glances were full of affection, his speech often accompanied by laughter. His natural charm was all in his brows; a lifetime of emotions gathered at the corners of his eyes. His appearance was exceptionally good, yet it was difficult to know his true nature. Later generations wrote two ""Xijiang Moon"" poems that aptly describe Baoyu, which read:"
"""Without reason, seeking sorrow and searching for hate, sometimes appearing foolish and mad. Even if blessed with a good appearance, inside is truly uncultivated. Down and out, ignorant of worldly affairs, too stubborn to read literature. Behaving eccentrically with a perverse nature, indifferent to the slander of others!"""
"Wealthy yet unaware of the joy of work, the poor find it hard to endure desolation. It's a pity to waste the good times, bringing no hope to the country or family. The most incompetent in the world, unmatched in unworthiness throughout history. A word to the pampered and privileged: do not emulate this person's ways!"
"Grandmother Jia laughed and said, ""You haven't even seen the guest yet, and you're already taking off your clothes. Go and meet your cousin!"" Baoyu had already noticed there was an additional sister and guessed that she must be Aunt Lin's daughter. He quickly came over to pay his respects. After the introductions, he returned to his seat and observed her closely, noticing that her appearance was quite different from the others."
"""Her eyebrows, arched like smoke, seem furrowed yet not, and her eyes, like dewdrops, appear tearful yet not. Her demeanor carries a hint of sorrow, and her delicate frame seems frail with illness. Tears glisten faintly, and her breath is gentle and soft. In moments of calm, she resembles a beautiful flower reflected in water; in movement, she is like a slender willow swaying in the breeze. Her heart is more perceptive than Bi Gan's, and her illness surpasses Xi Shi's by threefold."""
"After reading, Baoyu laughed and said, ""I have seen this sister before."" Grandmother Jia laughed and replied, ""That's nonsense. When have you ever seen her?"" Baoyu smiled and said, ""Although I haven't actually met her, she looks familiar to me, as if we are old acquaintances. Today, let's just consider it a reunion after a long separation, which is perfectly fine."" Grandmother Jia laughed and said, ""Even better, even better. If that's the case, you'll get along even more harmoniously."" Baoyu then sat down next to Daiyu and carefully observed her again, asking, ""Sister, have you studied?"" Daiyu replied, ""I haven't studied much, only attended school for a year, so I can recognize a few characters."" Baoyu then asked, ""Which characters are in your name?"" Daiyu told him her name. Baoyu asked about her courtesy name. Daiyu said, ""I don't have one."" Baoyu laughed and said, ""I'll give you a wonderful courtesy name. How about 'Pinpin'? It's quite fitting."" Tanchun asked where that came from. Baoyu said, ""In the 'Comprehensive Examination of Characters from Past and Present,' it says: 'In the West, there is a stone called dai, which can be used as eyebrow ink.' Moreover, Sister Lin's eyebrows seem to be slightly furrowed, so using these two characters is doubly fitting!"" Tanchun laughed and said, ""I'm afraid it's just another of your fabrications."" Baoyu laughed and said, ""There are too many fabrications outside of the 'Four Books.' Why can't I make one up?"" He then asked Daiyu, ""Do you also have a jade?"" The others didn't understand his question, but Daiyu guessed that since he had a jade, he was asking if she had one too, so she replied, ""I don't have one. I suppose that jade is a rare thing, not something everyone can have."""
"Upon hearing this, Baoyu immediately fell into a fit of madness. He took off the jade and threw it forcefully, cursing, ""What a worthless object! It can't even distinguish between people of different qualities, yet it claims to be 'spiritual' or not! I don't want this damn thing anymore!"" The people around were frightened and rushed to pick up the jade. Grandmother Jia anxiously embraced Baoyu and said, ""You wretched child! If you're angry, it's easy to scold or hit someone, but why throw away your precious treasure?"" Baoyu, with tears streaming down his face, cried, ""None of the sisters in the family have one, only I do, and I find it meaningless. Now, even this fairy-like sister doesn't have one, so it's clear this isn't a good thing."" Grandmother Jia hurriedly comforted him, saying, ""Your sister originally had one. When your aunt passed away, she couldn't bear to part with your sister, so she took her jade with her: firstly, to fulfill the burial rites and express your sister's filial piety; secondly, so that your aunt's spirit could feel as if she had seen her daughter. That's why she said she didn't have one, not wanting to boast about it herself. How can you compare to her now? You'd better wear it carefully, or your mother will find out."" Saying this, she took the jade from the maid's hands and personally put it back on him. Hearing this explanation, Baoyu thought it made a lot of sense and stopped arguing."
"At that moment, the wet nurse came to inquire about where Daiyu would be staying. Grandmother Jia said, ""For now, let's move Baoyu out to stay with me in the warm alcove of the suite, and temporarily place your cousin Lin in the green gauze cabinet. Once winter is over, we can arrange their rooms properly in the spring."" Baoyu replied, ""Dear Grandmother, I'm perfectly fine sleeping on the bed outside the green gauze cabinet. There's no need to disturb you by moving me out."" After thinking for a moment, Grandmother Jia said, ""Very well."" Each person was assigned a wet nurse and a maid to take care of them, while the others stayed outside to be on call at night. Meanwhile, Xifeng had already ordered someone to send over a lotus-colored floral canopy and several brocade quilts and satin bedding."
"Lin Daiyu brought only two people with her: one was her wet nurse since childhood, Wang Mama, and the other was a ten-year-old maid, who had also been with her since childhood, named Xueyan. Seeing that Xueyan was very young and childlike, and that Wang Mama was quite old, Grandmother Jia thought they might not be sufficient for Daiyu's needs. Therefore, she assigned one of her own second-class maids, named Yingge, to assist Daiyu. Additionally, as was customary for others like Yingchun, each person, aside from their childhood wet nurse, had four instructing mamas. Besides the two personal maids responsible for managing jewelry and bathing, there were also five or six young maids for cleaning and other tasks. At that moment, Wang Mama and Yingge were attending to Daiyu in the green gauze cabinet. Baoyu's wet nurse, Li Mama, along with a senior maid named Xiren, were attending outside on the large bed."
"The maid Xiren was originally a servant of Grandmother Jia and was originally named Pearl. Because Grandmother Jia doted on Baoyu and feared that Baoyu's maid might not be completely loyal and dedicated, she favored Xiren for her pure and kind nature and her diligence in fulfilling her duties, so she assigned her to Baoyu. Baoyu, knowing her original surname was Hua, once saw a line in an old poem that read ""the fragrance of flowers assails the senses,"" and thus suggested to Grandmother Jia to rename her Xiren. Xiren also had her own peculiarities: when serving Grandmother Jia, her heart and mind were solely focused on her; now serving Baoyu, her heart and mind are solely focused on him. However, due to Baoyu's capricious nature, he often disregarded her advice, which caused her genuine concern and worry."
"That night, Baoyu and Nanny Li had already fallen asleep. Seeing that Daiyu and Ying'er were still awake inside, Xiren quietly came in after removing her makeup and asked with a smile, ""Why are you girls still not resting?"" Daiyu quickly invited her, ""Sister, please sit."" Xiren sat on the edge of the bed. Ying'er laughed and said, ""Miss Lin is feeling sad here, wiping her tears and saying, 'I just arrived today and already caused your brother's madness. If that jade were to break, wouldn't it be my fault!' That's why she's upset, and I had a hard time comforting her."" Xiren said, ""Miss, please don't be like this. In the future, there might be even stranger jokes than this! If you get upset over his behavior, I'm afraid you'll never stop being sad. Don't overthink it!"" Daiyu replied, ""I will remember what you sisters said. But what exactly is the origin of that jade? Does it have any inscriptions on it?"" Xiren said, ""Even the family doesn't know its origin. There is a hole on it, and it's said that it was taken from his mouth when he was born. I'll bring it for you to see."" Daiyu quickly stopped her, ""No need, it's late now. We can look at it tomorrow."" They chatted for a while longer before finally going to rest."
"The next day, after paying her respects to Grandmother Jia, she went to visit Lady Wang. She found Lady Wang and Xifeng together, reading letters from Jinling. Additionally, two daughters-in-law sent by Lady Wang's elder brother and sister-in-law were there to deliver a message. Although Daiyu was unaware of the details, Tanchun and the others knew that the discussion was about their cousin Xue Pan from the Xue family in Jinling. He had relied on his wealth and influence to commit manslaughter, and the case was currently being tried in the Ying Tian Prefecture. Now that Uncle Wang Ziteng had received the news, he sent his household members to inform them here, with the intention of summoning Xue Pan to the capital."
