"This is the first chapter of the open book. The author himself states: Having experienced a dreamlike episode, I chose to conceal the true events and, using the concept of ""spiritual enlightenment,"" wrote this book ""The Story of the Stone."" Hence, it is said, ""Zhen Shiyin,"" and so on. But what events and people are recorded in the book? The author further states: ""Now, amidst the hustle and bustle of life, having achieved nothing, I suddenly recall the women of my past. Upon careful reflection, I find their conduct and insight surpass mine. How is it that I, a man of dignity, am inferior to these women? I am truly ashamed, yet regret is of no use in this situation! At this point, I wish to compile an account of my past, when I relied on the grace of heaven and the virtues of my ancestors, during the days of fine clothes and rich food, neglecting the education of my father and brothers and the guidance of my teachers and friends, leading to my current state of having no skills and a life half wasted, to inform the world: My faults are undeniable, but there were indeed remarkable women in the boudoir, and one must not let my unworthiness cause their stories to be forgotten. Even though today I live in a humble abode with a thatched roof and simple furnishings, the morning and evening winds, the dew, the willow by the steps, and the flowers in the courtyard do not hinder my thoughts and writing. Although I am unlearned and my writing lacks elegance, what harm is there in using colloquial language to craft a story? It can still make the tales of the boudoir known, delight the eyes of the world, and dispel people's melancholy. Is this not fitting?"" Hence, it is said, ""Jia Yucun,"" and so on."
"In this chapter, the use of words like ""dream"" and ""illusion"" is to remind the reader's attention and is also the fundamental intention of this book."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you may wonder where this book originates from. Although the story behind it might seem rather absurd at first, upon closer examination, it is quite intriguing. Allow me to explain its origins so that readers may understand and not be confused."
"When the goddess Nüwa was repairing the sky, she refined 36,501 large stones at the Wujiyai of the Great Wilderness Mountain, each measuring twelve zhang in height and twenty-four zhang in width. The goddess only used 36,500 of these stones, leaving just one unused, which she discarded at the foot of the Qinggeng Peak in this mountain. Little did anyone know that after being refined, this stone had become spiritually aware. Seeing that all the other stones were chosen to repair the sky while it alone was deemed unworthy, it lamented and sighed, feeling ashamed and sorrowful day and night."
"One day, while lamenting, I suddenly saw a monk and a Taoist coming from afar. They had extraordinary appearances and unique demeanors, and they approached the foot of the mountain, talking and laughing as they sat by a rock, engaging in lively discussions. Initially, they spoke of mystical matters such as clouds, mountains, misty seas, and immortals. Eventually, they began discussing the worldly glories and riches. The rock, upon hearing this, was moved by worldly desires and wished to experience these glories and riches in the human world. However, it lamented its own crudeness and, out of necessity, spoke in human language to the monk, saying, ""Master, I am a foolish creature and cannot offer proper greetings. I just heard you both discussing the worldly honors and prosperity, and I deeply yearn for them. Although I am crude in substance, I have some understanding in nature. Moreover, seeing your immortal forms and Taoist essence, you must possess extraordinary talents to mend the heavens and benefit the world, with virtues that aid others. If you could show a bit of compassion and take me into the mortal world to enjoy a few years in the realm of wealth and tenderness, I would forever be grateful and never forget your great kindness."" The two immortals listened and chuckled together, saying, ""Well said, well said! There are indeed some pleasures in the mortal world, but they cannot be relied upon forever. Moreover, there are the words 'imperfection in beauty, many obstacles in good things' closely associated with it. In an instant, joy turns to sorrow, people and things change, and ultimately, it is all but a dream, with all things returning to emptiness. It might be better not to go at all."""
"The heart of the stone was already fervent, and it couldn't listen to these words. It continued to plead earnestly. The two immortals, knowing they couldn't force it, sighed and said, ""This is indeed the desire for movement after extreme stillness, creating something out of nothing. Since this is the case, we will take you to enjoy yourself, but when things don't go as you wish, don't regret it."" The stone replied, ""Naturally, naturally."" The monk added, ""Although your spirit is lively, you are rather dull and lack any remarkable qualities. In this state, you can only make limited progress. Very well, I will now use great Buddhist magic to assist you. When the calamity ends, you will return to your original form, thus resolving this matter. What do you think?"" The stone, upon hearing this, was immensely grateful. The monk then chanted incantations and drew symbols, performing great magic, transforming the large stone into a bright and clear beautiful jade, shrinking it to the size of a pendant that could be worn or held. The monk held it in his palm and laughed, ""Its form is now a treasure! But it still lacks real merit. It needs to be engraved with characters so that people will recognize it as a wonder at first sight. Then we will take you to a prosperous and flourishing land, among families of poetry and etiquette, in a place of floral and willow splendor, a gentle and wealthy region to settle and thrive."" The stone, overjoyed, asked, ""I wonder what special qualities you have bestowed upon me, and where you will take me? Please enlighten me so I won't be confused."" The monk laughed and said, ""Don't ask for now; you will naturally understand in the future."" With that, he tucked the stone into his sleeve, and together with the Taoist, they floated away, leaving no trace of where they went."
"Later, after an unknown number of lifetimes and kalpas, an empty-minded Daoist seeking the Way and immortality happened to pass by the foot of the Azure Ridge Peak of the Boundless Mountain. Suddenly, he noticed clear inscriptions on a large stone, detailing a vivid account. The empty-minded Daoist began to read from the beginning and realized it was the story of a stone that, lacking the material to mend the heavens, transformed into the mortal world. It was taken into the mundane world by the Vast Vast Bodhisattva and the Boundless Boundless Immortal, experiencing the joys and sorrows, the warmth and coldness of worldly affairs. Following this was a verse that read:"
"""Without the means to mend the vast sky, I have wandered in the mortal world for so many years in vain. These are matters of life and death; who will remember them to create a remarkable tale?"""
"""After the poem comes the place where this stone fell and was reincarnated, a story of past experiences personally encountered. It includes trivial family matters and leisurely poetry, which might serve to amuse and relieve boredom; however, the dynastic era, geographical locations, and nations have unfortunately been lost and cannot be verified."""
"The Empty Daoist said to the Stone, ""Brother Stone, this story of yours, which you claim has some interest, is written here with the intention of becoming a legendary tale. From my perspective, first, there is no dynasty or era that can be verified; second, there are no great sages or loyal ministers governing the court and improving customs, only a few unusual women who are either sentimental or foolish, or possess minor talents and virtues, lacking the moral capabilities of figures like Ban Zhao or Cai Wenji. Even if I were to copy it, I fear people might not enjoy reading it.""

The Stone replied with a smile, ""Why is my master so naive? If you say there is no dynasty to verify, why not simply borrow the years of the Han or Tang dynasties to embellish it? However, I think that since ancient times, unofficial histories have all followed the same pattern, whereas my story, which does not rely on such conventions, is instead novel and distinctive, focusing merely on the essence of the events and emotions. Why be constrained by dynasties and eras? Moreover, few common people enjoy reading books on governance, while many love leisurely and amusing writings. Historically, unofficial histories often satirize rulers and ministers or disparage wives and daughters, filled with countless tales of adultery and wickedness. There is also a type of romantic writing that is so obscene and foul that it corrupts the youth, again in countless numbers. As for books about talented scholars and beautiful women, they all follow the same formula, inevitably involving licentiousness, filling pages with figures like Pan An, Zixian, Xishi, and Wenjun, merely to showcase the author's own romantic poems and essays. They invent names for a pair of male and female characters and introduce a villain to create chaos, much like the clown in a play. The maidservants speak in an affected manner, either literary or logical, resulting in contradictions and implausible stories. In contrast, the few women I have personally seen and heard about in my life, though I dare not claim they surpass those in ancient books, have stories and backgrounds that can relieve boredom and melancholy. There are also a few humorous poems and sayings that can amuse and entertain. As for the themes of separation and reunion, joy and sorrow, rise and fall, they are traced and followed without embellishment, merely to provide visual enjoyment without losing the true essence. Nowadays, the poor are burdened by daily needs, while the rich are never satisfied. Even when they have some leisure time, they indulge in lust and greed, leaving no time for books on governance. Therefore, I do not wish for my story to be acclaimed as extraordinary, nor do I expect people to enjoy reading it. I only hope that when they are indulging in pleasure or avoiding worries, they might take a look at it, sparing some of their life and energy. Compared to chasing illusions and falsehoods, it also spares them the trouble of gossip and the hardship of running around. Furthermore, it offers people a fresh perspective, unlike those old manuscripts filled with clichéd plots of talented scholars and beautiful women, Zixian, Wenjun, Hongniang, and Xiaoyu. What does my master think?"""
"The Empty Daoist, upon hearing this, pondered for a while and reviewed ""The Story of the Stone"" once more. He noticed that although the text contained some criticisms of treachery and flattery, and condemnation of evil and wickedness, it did not aim to lament the times or criticize society. When it came to matters concerning the virtues of benevolent rulers, loyal ministers, kind fathers, and filial sons, all related to ethical norms, the text was full of praise and admiration, incomparable to other works. Although the main theme discussed emotions, it merely recorded events truthfully, unlike those works filled with fabricated tales of lustful invitations, romantic rendezvous, and secret pacts. Since it did not interfere with contemporary affairs, he transcribed it from beginning to end, presenting it as a legendary tale. From then on, the Empty Daoist, seeing form in emptiness and developing emotions from form, transmitted emotions into form, and realized emptiness through form, thus changed his name to the Passionate Monk and renamed ""The Story of the Stone"" to ""The Record of the Passionate Monk."" Kong Meixi from Eastern Lu titled it ""The Mirror of Love and Desire."" Later, Cao Xueqin, after ten years of reading and editing in the Red Inkstone Studio, revising it five times, compiling a directory, and dividing it into chapters, titled it ""The Twelve Beauties of Jinling."" He also inscribed a quatrain:"
"The pages are filled with absurd words, a handful of bitter tears. Everyone says the author is foolish, but who can truly understand the meaning within?"
"""Once outside, it becomes clear. Let's see what story is on the stone. According to the writing on the stone, it says:"""
"On that day, the ground subsided in the southeast. In this southeastern corner, there is a place called Gusu, with a city named Changmen, which is one of the most affluent and elegant places in the mundane world. Outside Changmen, there is a street called Ten-Mile Street. Within this street, there is a lane called Renqing Lane, and within the lane, there is an ancient temple. Due to the narrowness of the location, people call it the Gourd Temple. Next to the temple lives a local gentry family with the surname Zhen. The head of the family is named Fei, with the courtesy name Shiyin. His wife, Madam Feng, is virtuous and well-versed in etiquette. Although the family is not extremely wealthy, they are considered a prominent family in the area. Because Zhen Shiyin has a calm and indifferent nature, he does not concern himself with fame and fortune, and finds joy in admiring flowers, cultivating bamboo, drinking wine, and composing poetry, resembling the character of an immortal. However, there is one shortcoming: he is now in his fifties and has no sons, only a daughter named Yinglian, who is three years old."
"One day, during the long days of a scorching summer, Shi Yin was idly sitting in his study. When his hands grew tired, he set the book aside and rested on the table for a short nap, unknowingly drifting into a slumber. In his dream, he arrived at a place he couldn't identify. Suddenly, he saw a monk and a Taoist approaching from the other side, walking and conversing as they went."
"The Daoist asked, ""Where do you intend to go with this foolish creature?"" The monk laughed and replied, ""Don't worry. There is currently a romantic case that needs to be resolved. A group of romantic souls has yet to be reincarnated into the world. Taking this opportunity, I will send this foolish creature along to experience it."" The Daoist said, ""So it seems that recent romantic entanglements are about to create a calamity and reincarnate into the world? But where will they end up?"" The monk laughed and said, ""This matter is quite amusing, something unheard of through the ages. It all started because there was a Blade of Red Pearl Grass on the banks of the Spirit River in the West. It was often watered with sweet dew by the Divine Attendant of the Red Jade Palace, which allowed the Red Pearl Grass to extend its life. Later, after absorbing the essence of heaven and earth and being nourished by rain and dew, it was able to shed its plant form and transform into a human shape, becoming a female. She roamed beyond the Heaven of Unfulfilled Longings, eating honey and green fruits when hungry and drinking water from the Sea of Sorrows when thirsty. Because she had not yet repaid the kindness of being watered, her heart was filled with an endless longing. Recently, the Divine Attendant's mortal desires flared up, and taking advantage of the prosperous and peaceful era, he wished to descend to the mortal world to experience illusory fates. He has already registered with the Fairy of Illusion. The Fairy of Illusion also mentioned that the debt of watering had not been repaid, and this was a good opportunity to resolve it. The Fairy of Red Pearl said, 'He bestowed the grace of sweet dew upon me, but I have no such water to repay him. Since he is descending to the mortal world, I will also go down as a human and repay him with all the tears of my lifetime.' Because of this, many romantic souls were drawn in to accompany them in resolving this case."""
"The Taoist said, ""Indeed, it is rarely heard of. I have truly never heard of such a thing as returning tears. It seems that this story is even more intricate and detailed than the romantic affairs of the past."" The monk replied, ""The few romantic figures throughout history have only had their general stories and poems passed down. The daily lives within families and boudoirs, such as meals and drinks, have never been recorded. Moreover, most romantic tales are merely about secret trysts and elopements, without revealing any genuine emotions of love and affection. It seems that these people entering the world, whether they are passionate fools, lustful ghosts, virtuous or foolish, differ greatly from those previously recounted."" The Taoist said, ""Why don't we take this opportunity to descend into the world and save a few souls ourselves? Wouldn't that be a meritorious deed?"" The monk responded, ""That aligns perfectly with my intentions. Come with me to the Palace of the Fairy of Illusion to settle these matters. Once these romantic spirits have descended, we can proceed. Although half have already fallen into the mortal world, the process is not yet complete."" The Taoist said, ""In that case, I shall follow you."""
"Here is the translation of the provided Chinese text:

Zhen Shiyin understood everything he heard, but he did not know what the term ""foolish creature"" referred to. Unable to resist, he stepped forward, bowed, and with a smile asked, ""Greetings to the two immortal masters."" The monk quickly returned the greeting and inquired. Shiyin then said, ""I just heard the immortal masters discussing cause and effect, which is indeed rare in the human world. However, I am ignorant and cannot fully comprehend it. If you could kindly enlighten me in detail, I would listen attentively, and perhaps I could avoid the suffering of being lost."" The two immortals laughed and said, ""This is a mystery that cannot be revealed in advance. When the time comes, just don't forget the two of us, and you will be able to escape the pit of fire."" Hearing this, Shiyin did not press further. He smiled and said, ""The mystery cannot be revealed, but you mentioned a 'foolish creature.' I wonder what it is, and if I might have a look?"" The monk said, ""If you ask about this creature, there is indeed a chance to see it."" With that, he took it out and handed it to Shiyin."
"Shi Yin received it and saw that it was a piece of bright, beautiful jade. The characters were clearly engraved on it, reading ""The Precious Jade of Spiritual Perception."" On the back, there were several lines of small characters. Just as he was about to examine it closely, the monk said they had arrived at the Illusory Realm and forcibly took it from his hand. Together with the Taoist, they passed through a large stone archway inscribed with four large characters: ""The Land of Illusion."" On either side, there was a couplet that read:"
"When the false seems true, the true becomes false; where there is nothing, there is something, and where there is something, there is nothing."
"Shi Yin intended to follow along, but just as he was about to take a step, he suddenly heard a thunderous crash, as if the mountains were collapsing and the ground was splitting. Shi Yin cried out in alarm and, upon focusing his gaze, saw the scorching sun blazing and the banana trees swaying gently. He forgot most of what he had dreamed. He then saw the nursemaid approaching with Yinglian in her arms. Shi Yin noticed that his daughter was becoming more and more exquisitely beautiful, like a porcelain doll, clever and delightful. He reached out to take her into his arms, played with her for a while, and then took her to the street to enjoy the lively scene."
"As Fang was about to enter, he saw a monk and a Taoist approaching from the other side. The monk had a scabby head and was barefoot, while the Taoist had a lame foot and disheveled hair. They appeared to be mad, laughing and chatting as they came. When they reached his door, they saw Shi Yin holding Yinglian. The monk began to weep loudly and said to Shi Yin, ""Benefactor, why do you hold in your arms this child who has life but no fortune, bringing misfortune to her parents?"" Shi Yin, hearing this, knew it was nonsense and ignored him. The monk continued, ""Let her go, let her go!"" Shi Yin, growing impatient, was about to carry his daughter inside when the monk pointed at him and laughed, reciting four lines of verse."
"Indulgence and pampering make you seem foolish, as you face the mirror with a smile while snow melts away. Be cautious after the Lantern Festival, for it is the time when smoke dissipates and fire extinguishes."
"Shi Yin understood clearly and hesitated in his heart, wanting to ask about their origins. He only heard the Taoist say, ""We do not need to travel together. Let us part ways here and each attend to our own affairs. Three kalpas later, I will wait for you at Mount Bei Mang, and once we are all gathered, we will go to the Land of Illusion to cancel our accounts."" The monk said, ""Most wonderful, most wonderful!"" After saying this, the two left and were never seen again. At this moment, Shi Yin thought to himself: These two people must have a background, I should have tried to ask them, but now it is too late to regret."
"Jia Yucun was lost in thought when he suddenly saw a poor scholar residing in the neighboring Gourd Temple walk out. This scholar, named Jia Hua with the courtesy name Biaoshifei and the alias Yucun, was originally from Huzhou. He came from a family of poets and officials, but since he was born in a declining era, his family's foundation had been exhausted, and with his relatives deceased, he was left alone. Finding no benefit in staying in his hometown, he went to the capital to seek fame and rebuild his family's legacy. Having arrived here the previous year, he found himself stranded and temporarily took shelter in the temple, making a living by selling calligraphy and writing. As a result, he often interacted with Shi Yin."
"When Yu-cun saw Shi-yin, he quickly greeted him with a bow and a smile, saying, ""Sir, you were standing by the door watching. Is there any news from the street?"" Shi-yin replied with a smile, ""Not at all. My young daughter was crying, so I brought her out to play. I was feeling quite bored, and your arrival is most timely. Please come into my study for a chat, and we can both while away this long day."" As he spoke, he instructed someone to take his daughter inside, and then he and Yu-cun walked hand in hand to the study. A young servant brought them tea. They had only exchanged a few words when suddenly a servant came rushing in to report, ""Master Yan is here to visit."" Shi-yin hurriedly stood up and apologized, saying, ""Please forgive my abrupt departure. Stay seated, and I will return shortly to keep you company."" Yu-cun also stood up and insisted, ""Please, sir, attend to your guest. I am a frequent visitor, and waiting a while is no trouble."" With that, Shi-yin left for the front hall."
"Here, Yu Cun was idly flipping through books to relieve his boredom. Suddenly, he heard a woman's cough outside the window. Yu Cun got up to take a look and saw that it was a maid picking flowers. She had an uncommon appearance, with clear and bright eyes. Although she wasn't exceptionally beautiful, there was something captivating about her. Yu Cun couldn't help but stare in a daze."
"The maid from the Zhen family had just picked some flowers and was about to leave when she suddenly looked up and saw someone inside the window. Despite his shabby attire and worn-out headscarf, he had a sturdy build with a broad back, a wide face, and a square mouth, complemented by sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes, a straight nose, and prominent cheeks. The maid quickly turned away, thinking to herself, ""This man looks so robust yet is dressed so poorly. He must be the Jia Yucun my master often mentions, always wanting to help him but never having the chance. We have no relatives or friends in such dire straits, so it must be him. No wonder they say he won't remain in hardship for long."" With these thoughts, she couldn't help but glance back twice."
"When Yu Cun saw him turn his head, he assumed that the woman had feelings for him and was overjoyed, believing that she must be a perceptive and heroic figure, a kindred spirit amidst the mundane world. At that moment, a young servant came in, and Yu Cun learned that there was a meal being prepared ahead and he shouldn't linger too long. So, he discreetly left through the side path. After the guests had departed, Shi Yin realized that Yu Cun had left on his own accord and did not invite him back."
"One day, it was once again the Mid-Autumn Festival. After the family banquet at Shi Yin's home had concluded, he prepared an additional setting in the study and then walked to the temple to invite Yu Cun. It turns out that ever since Yu Cun had seen the maid from the Zhen family glance back at him twice, he considered her a kindred spirit and kept her in his thoughts constantly. Now, with the Mid-Autumn Festival upon him, he couldn't help but feel nostalgic under the moon, and thus composed a five-character regulated verse:"
"""Uncertain of future lives, frequently adding a layer of sorrow. When troubled, I furrow my brow, looking back several times as I walk away. Gazing at my shadow in the wind, who can be my companion under the moon? If the moonlight has intentions, it would first shine upon the jade person's tower."""
"After reciting the poem in the Rain Village, he thought about his lifelong ambitions, lamenting that he had not yet met the right opportunity. He scratched his head, sighed deeply towards the sky, and then recited another couplet aloud:"
"The jade seeks a good price while still in the stone, and the hairpin waits in the jewelry box for the right time to shine."
"Just as Shi Yin was walking over and heard this, he laughed and said, ""Brother Yu Cun, you truly have great ambitions!"" Yu Cun quickly replied with a smile, ""I was merely reciting the verses of predecessors, how dare I be so presumptuous."" He then asked, ""What brings you here, sir?"" Shi Yin smiled and said, ""Tonight is the Mid-Autumn Festival, commonly known as the 'Festival of Reunion.' I thought that since you are staying in a monk's quarters, you might feel a bit lonely. Therefore, I have prepared a small gathering and would like to invite you to my humble abode for a drink. Would you accept my invitation?"" Yu Cun, hearing this, did not decline and smiled, ""Since you are so kind, how could I refuse such gracious hospitality?"" With that, he accompanied Shi Yin back to the academy."
"After a short while, the tea was finished, and the table was already set with cups and plates, not to mention the fine wine and delicious dishes. The two returned to their seats, first pouring and drinking leisurely, then gradually engaging in lively conversation, unconsciously raising their cups in frequent toasts. At that time, every household in the neighborhood was playing flutes and pipes, and every home was filled with singing, with a bright full moon overhead casting its radiant glow. The two became even more spirited, drinking until their cups were dry. By this time, Yucun was already quite tipsy, his exuberance unrestrained. He expressed his feelings to the moon with an impromptu verse:"
"At the time of the third or fifth day, we gather together, holding the clear light to protect the jade railing. As the moon emerges in the sky, people on earth look up in admiration."
"Upon hearing this, Shi Yin exclaimed, ""Wonderful! I have always believed that you are not one to remain under others for long. The lines you recited reveal signs of soaring success, and soon you will ascend to great heights. Congratulations, congratulations!"" He then personally poured a cup of wine to celebrate. Yu Cun, after drinking it, sighed and said, ""This is not just drunken talk. If we speak of contemporary studies, I might be able to make a name for myself. However, I currently have no means for travel expenses, and the road to the capital is long. I cannot rely solely on selling calligraphy or writing to get there."" Before he could finish, Shi Yin interrupted, ""Why did you not mention this earlier? I have always had this intention, but whenever I met you, you never brought it up, so I dared not be presumptuous. Now that you have mentioned it, although I am not talented, I do understand the words 'righteousness' and 'profit.' Fortunately, next year is the grand examination. You should quickly head to the capital and participate in the spring examination to not waste your learning. As for travel expenses, I will take care of them, so your acquaintance with me will not be in vain!"" He then instructed a servant to prepare fifty taels of silver and two sets of winter clothing. He added, ""The nineteenth is an auspicious day; you should buy a boat ticket to the west. Once you achieve success, we shall meet again next winter. Wouldn't that be a great joy?"" Yu Cun accepted the silver and clothing, offered a brief word of thanks, and continued drinking and chatting without much concern. It was already the third watch of the night when the two finally parted ways."
"After sending Yu Cun off, Shi Yin returned to his room and slept until the sun was high in the sky. Reflecting on the events of the previous night, he intended to write two more recommendation letters for Yu Cun to take to the capital, hoping Yu Cun could find a place to stay with an official family. When he sent someone to invite Yu Cun over, the messenger returned and said, ""The monk said that Master Jia left for the capital at dawn and left a message for you, saying, 'For a scholar, the path is not as important as the principles; there's no need for a formal farewell.'"" Hearing this, Shi Yin had no choice but to let it go."
"Time passes easily in leisure, and suddenly it is the Lantern Festival again. Shi Yin instructed his servant Huo Qi to take Yinglian to see the festive fireworks and lanterns. In the middle of the night, Huo Qi needed to relieve himself, so he placed Yinglian on the doorstep of a house to sit. When he returned after relieving himself, Yinglian was nowhere to be found. Anxiously, Huo Qi searched for half the night, and by dawn, she was still missing. Fearing to face his master, Huo Qi fled to another place. Shi Yin and his wife, realizing their daughter had not returned all night, knew something was amiss. They sent several people to search for her, but all returned saying there was no trace or sound of her. The couple, having only this daughter in their lifetime, were devastated by her loss and wept day and night, nearly driven to despair. After about a month, Shi Yin fell ill, and Madam Feng also became ill from longing for her daughter, requiring daily medical treatment."
"On the fifteenth day of the third month, unexpectedly, there was an explosion at the Gourd Temple. The monks, being careless, allowed the fire from the oil pot to escape, which then ignited the window paper. In this area, many houses were made of bamboo fences and wooden walls, and perhaps due to fate, the fire spread rapidly, engulfing one house after another, turning the entire street into a scene resembling the Flaming Mountains. Although soldiers and civilians came to the rescue, the fire had already gained momentum, making it impossible to extinguish. It burned throughout the night before gradually dying down, and no one knew how many homes were destroyed. Unfortunately, the Zhen family's house next door was reduced to rubble. Fortunately, the lives of the couple and a few servants were spared. Shi Yin could only stomp his feet and sigh in despair. He had no choice but to discuss with his wife about temporarily relocating to their countryside estate. However, in recent years, due to droughts and floods, harvests had failed, and bandits were rampant, seizing land and stealing, leaving the people in distress. As a result, government troops were dispatched to suppress the bandits, making it difficult to find peace. Shi Yin had to sell off the estate and then took his wife and two maids to seek refuge at his father-in-law's home."
"His father-in-law was named Feng Su, originally from Dayu Prefecture. Although he was a farmer, his family was still quite well-off. Now seeing his son-in-law arriving in such a sorry state, he felt somewhat displeased. Fortunately, Shi Yin still had some money left from selling his land, which he used to ask Feng Su to help him purchase a small amount of property at a reasonable price as a means of future livelihood. Feng Su, half deceiving and half exploiting him, gave him some meager fields and dilapidated houses. Being a scholar, Shi Yin was not accustomed to farming or business, and after struggling to make ends meet for a year or two, he found himself sinking deeper into poverty. Whenever Feng Su saw him, he would make some superficial remarks and complain to others about their inability to manage their lives, accusing them of being lazy and indulgent. Shi Yin realized he could not rely on others, and his heart was filled with regret. Coupled with the fright from the previous year and the accumulated anger and resentment, he had already developed chronic ailments. In his old age, poverty and illness besieged him, gradually revealing signs of his impending demise."
"On this particular day, while leaning on a cane to make his way to the street for a change of scenery, he suddenly saw a lame Taoist approaching from the other side. The Taoist appeared disheveled and eccentric, wearing tattered clothes and straw sandals, muttering a few phrases to himself, saying:"
"The world knows the immortals are good, yet only fame and fortune are hard to forget! Where are the generals and ministers of the past? A desolate grave overgrown with weeds. The world knows the immortals are good, yet only gold and silver are hard to forget! All day long, one laments having too little, but when there is plenty, the eyes close forever. The world knows the immortals are good, yet only a beautiful wife is hard to forget! While alive, he speaks of love every day, but when he dies, she follows another. The world knows the immortals are good, yet only children and grandchildren are hard to forget! Foolish parents have been many throughout history, but who has seen truly filial descendants?"
"Upon hearing this, Shi Yin approached and said, ""What are you talking about? All I hear is 'good' and 'done'."" The Taoist laughed and said, ""If you truly hear the words 'good' and 'done', then you understand. In this world, everything is good when it's done, and done when it's good. If it's not done, it's not good; if you want it to be good, it must be done. This song of mine is called the 'Song of Being Done'."" Shi Yin, who was naturally insightful, immediately comprehended upon hearing this. He smiled and said, ""Hold on! How about I interpret your 'Song of Being Done'?"" The Taoist laughed and said, ""Go ahead, interpret it."" Shi Yin then said:"
"The once bustling halls and rooms are now empty and bare; the withered grass and dried willows were once a place of song and dance. Spider webs cover the carved beams, and green gauze now patches the windows of the humble abode. Once the rouge was fresh and the powder fragrant, how have the temples turned gray? Yesterday, yellow earth covered the bones, today, under the red lanterns, lovers lie together. Chests full of gold and silver, yet in the blink of an eye, a beggar is scorned by all. While lamenting the short lives of others, who knew one's own end was near! Well-disciplined children might not necessarily grow up to be strong and virtuous. Choosing a life of luxury, who would expect to end up in a brothel? Discontent with a small official cap, led to carrying shackles; once pitying the cold in a tattered coat, now disdaining the length of a purple robe: in the chaotic world, as one finishes singing, another takes the stage, mistaking a foreign land for home. How absurd, in the end, all is for making wedding clothes for others!"
"The mad, limping Taoist clapped his hands and laughed, ""You got it right, you got it right!"" Shi Yin then said, ""Let's go!"" He snatched the bag from the Taoist's shoulder, carried it himself, and without returning home, drifted away with the mad Taoist. This caused quite a stir in the neighborhood, and people spread it as news. When Madam Feng heard the news, she cried as if her life depended on it. She had no choice but to discuss with her father and send people everywhere to search for him, but there was no news to be found. Helpless, she had to rely on her parents to get by. Fortunately, she still had two old maids to serve her, and the three of them worked day and night on needlework to sell, helping to support her father. Although Feng Su complained every day, there was nothing he could do."
"On that day, the eldest maid of the Zhen family was buying thread in front of the door when she suddenly heard the sound of people shouting in the street, announcing the arrival of the new magistrate. The maid hid inside the door to watch and saw pairs of constables passing by. Shortly after, a large sedan chair carried an official wearing a black hat and a red robe past her. The maid was taken aback, thinking that the official looked familiar, as if she had seen him somewhere before. She then went back inside and didn't give it much thought. Later in the evening, just as she was about to rest, there was a sudden loud knocking on the door and a commotion of people shouting, ""The magistrate has sent someone to summon a person for questioning."" Feng Su was so shocked that he was left speechless, not knowing what trouble had occurred. Stay tuned for the next installment."
