"The passage describes how Feng Su, upon hearing the constables calling, hurried out with a smile to inquire. The men shouted, ""Quickly bring out Master Zhen!"" Feng Su quickly responded with a smile, ""I am surnamed Feng, not Zhen. Only my son-in-law was surnamed Zhen, but he became a monk a year or two ago. Are you perhaps looking for him?"" The constables replied, ""We don't know about any 'real' or 'fake' Zhen. We are here on orders from the magistrate to inquire. Since he is your son-in-law, you should come with us to meet the magistrate in person, to avoid unnecessary trouble."" With that, they didn't allow Feng Su to say more and pushed him along. The Feng family was left in a state of panic, not knowing what this omen might mean."
"Please translate the following Chinese content into English: 

That day, around the second watch, Feng Su returned, full of joy. Everyone hurriedly asked what had happened. He said, ""It turns out that the newly appointed magistrate of this prefecture is named Jia Hua, originally from Huzhou, and he used to have connections with my son-in-law. He just passed by our door and saw the maid Jiao Xing buying thread, so he assumed my son-in-law had moved here. I explained the situation to him in detail, and the magistrate was quite moved and sighed for a while. He also inquired about my granddaughter, and I told him she got lost while watching the lanterns. The magistrate said, 'Don't worry, I will have the officers make every effort to find her.' After talking for a while, he even gave me two taels of silver before leaving."" Upon hearing this, Madam Zhen felt a pang of sadness in her heart. The night passed without further incident."
"The next day, Yu Cun sent someone with two ingots of silver and four bolts of brocade to express his gratitude to Lady Zhen. He also sent a secret letter to Feng Su, asking him to request Lady Zhen to give Jiao Xing as a concubine. Feng Su was overjoyed and eager to oblige, so he persuaded his daughter to agree. Under the cover of night, they used a small sedan chair to send Jiao Xing over. Yu Cun was naturally delighted and gave Feng Su a hundred gold pieces as a reward, along with many gifts to Lady Zhen, asking her to take good care of herself while he searched for his daughter's whereabouts. Feng Su returned home without further ado."
"The maid named Jiao Xing was the one who had looked back at Yu Cun that year. It was due to a casual glance that this unexpected relationship developed, a serendipitous event beyond her own expectations. Who would have thought that her fate would turn out so favorably? Unexpectedly, after joining Yu Cun, she bore him a son within a year. Half a year later, Yu Cun's legitimate wife suddenly fell ill and passed away, and Yu Cun then elevated her to the position of his principal wife. Indeed:"
"By a single mistake, one can become superior to others."
"It turned out that after receiving silver from Shi Yin that year, Yu Cun set off for the capital on the sixteenth day. By the time of the imperial examination, he unexpectedly performed very well, passed the exam, and was selected for a position in the outer court. He has now been promoted to the position of prefect. Although he is highly capable, he inevitably has some flaws of greed and cruelty; moreover, he relies on his talent to disrespect his superiors, causing other officials to view him with disdain. In less than a year, his superiors found a pretext to accuse him in a report, stating that he was ""cunning and deceitful, arbitrarily altering rituals, falsely claiming integrity while secretly associating with corrupt individuals, causing disturbances in the region and suffering among the people."" The emperor was furious and immediately ordered his dismissal. When the official document arrived, all the local officials were delighted. Although Yu Cun felt deeply ashamed and resentful, he showed no sign of grievance on his face, remaining cheerful and carefree. After handing over his official duties, he sent his accumulated savings and family back to his hometown, arranging everything properly. He then set off on his own, traveling to enjoy the scenic wonders of the world."
"On that day, I happened to travel to the region of Yangzhou and heard that this year's salt administration official appointed was Lin Ruhai. Lin Ruhai, whose surname is Lin and courtesy name is Biao Ruhai, was a former top scholar in the imperial examinations and has now been promoted to the position of a senior official at the Lantai Temple. He is originally from Suzhou and has been specially appointed as the Imperial Inspector of Salt, having been in office for just over a month. It turns out that Lin Ruhai's ancestors once held the title of marquis, and Ruhai is the fifth generation. Initially, the title was to be inherited for only three generations, but due to the current emperor's exceptional grace and virtue, an additional favor was granted, allowing Ruhai's father to inherit the title for another generation. Ruhai himself rose through the ranks via the imperial examinations. Although his family is one of nobility and wealth, they are also a scholarly lineage. Unfortunately, the Lin family does not have many branches, and their descendants are limited. Although there are several family lines, they are all distant relatives to Ruhai, with no direct heirs. Ruhai is now forty years old and had only one three-year-old son, who unfortunately passed away last year. Despite having several concubines, he has no children due to fate, leaving him with no options. Currently, his legitimate wife, née Jia, has given birth to a daughter named Daiyu, who is just five years old. With no sons, the couple cherishes her like a precious gem. Seeing her intelligence and grace, they wish for her to learn to read and write a few characters, partly to fill the void of not having a son and to alleviate the loneliness at home."
"Yu Cun was suffering from a cold and was bedridden in an inn for about a month before gradually recovering. Due to physical exhaustion and a lack of funds, he was considering finding a suitable place to temporarily settle down. Fortunately, he had two old friends living in the area who informed him that the salt administration was looking to hire a tutor. Yu Cun asked for their help in securing the position as a means to make a living. Interestingly, there was only one female student and two maidservants accompanying her. The female student was very young and frail, and the workload was not demanding, making it a relatively easy job."
"Another year has passed, and who would have expected that the mother of the female student, Madam Jia, would suddenly pass away due to an illness. The female student attended to her mother with soup and medicine, and mourned her loss with deep sorrow, thus deciding to leave the school and seek other plans. Lin Ruhai intended for the girl to observe mourning and continue her studies, so he kept her there. Recently, due to her excessive grief, the girl, who was already frail and often ill, relapsed into an old ailment and had not attended school for several days. Yu Cun, feeling bored during his idle days, would often go out for a leisurely walk after meals whenever the weather was pleasant."
"On this day, I happened to venture outside the city walls, intending to appreciate the rural scenery. Suddenly, I found myself wandering to a place encircled by mountains and surrounded by winding waters, with dense forests and deep bamboo groves. There, faintly visible, stood a temple. Its entrance was dilapidated, and the walls were decayed. Above the door was a plaque inscribed with the words ""Zhitong Temple."" Beside the door was an old, tattered couplet, which read:"
"""With surplus behind, one forgets to hold back; with no road ahead, one wishes to turn back."""
"Yu Village looked at it and thought, ""These two sentences, though simple in wording, have a deep meaning. I've visited some famous mountains and temples, but I've never encountered such a saying. There might be something profound behind it, so why not go in and try?"" With this in mind, he walked in and saw only an old, decrepit monk there cooking porridge. Seeing this, Yu Village paid no attention. When he asked the monk about the two sentences, the old monk, being both deaf and muddle-headed, with missing teeth and a clumsy tongue, answered irrelevantly."
"Yu Cun, feeling impatient, decided to step outside with the intention of heading to the village tavern to have a few drinks and enhance his enjoyment of the countryside. He walked leisurely towards the tavern. As he was about to enter, he saw a guest at one of the tables stand up and laugh heartily, greeting him with the words, ""What a coincidence, what a coincidence."" Yu Cun quickly looked and recognized the person as Leng Zixing, who was known in the capital for trading in antiques. They were old acquaintances. Yu Cun greatly admired Leng Zixing as a capable and accomplished person, while Zixing appreciated Yu Cun's scholarly reputation. As a result, their conversations were always engaging and they got along very well."
"Yu Village smiled and asked, ""When did you arrive, my dear friend? I was completely unaware. Meeting you by chance today is truly a stroke of fate."" Zixing replied, ""I returned home at the end of last year. Now, as I need to go to the capital, I decided to stop by to say a word to an old friend here. Out of kindness, he insisted I stay a few more days. Since I have no pressing matters, I thought I would linger for a couple of days and then set off around mid-month. Today, my friend is occupied, so I took a leisurely stroll here to rest my feet, and unexpectedly, we met by such coincidence!"" As he spoke, he invited Yu Village to sit with him and ordered more food and wine. The two of them chatted casually and drank, discussing events that had occurred since they last met."
"Yu Village inquired, ""Is there any news in the capital recently?"" Zixing replied, ""There isn't much news, but there is a small unusual event related to your esteemed clan."" Yu Village laughed and said, ""There is no one from my clan in the capital, so how could this be related?"" Zixing chuckled and said, ""You share the same surname, aren't you from the same clan?"" Yu Village asked which family it was. Zixing replied, ""The Jia family of the Rongguo Mansion, does this not tarnish your family's reputation?"" Yu Village laughed and said, ""So it's their family. If we talk about it, my humble clan has quite a few members. Since Jia Fu of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the branches have flourished, and they are present in every province. Who can meticulously trace them all? As for the Rongguo branch, we do share the same genealogy. But with their kind of glory, we dare not associate ourselves with them, and over time, we've become even more distant and unrecognizable."""
"Zi Xing sighed and said, ""Old sir, please don't say that. Nowadays, the Ning and Rong households are both in decline, not like the glorious days of the past."" Yu Cun replied, ""In the past, the Ning and Rong residences had many people. How could they have fallen into decline?"" Leng Zi Xing said, ""Indeed, it's a long story."" Yu Cun said, ""Last year, I traveled to the Jinling area to explore the relics of the Six Dynasties. That day, I entered the Stone City and passed by the gates of their old residences. To the east of the street is the Ningguo Mansion, and to the west is the Rongguo Mansion. The two residences are connected, occupying almost half of the street. Although the front gates were deserted and empty, looking over the walls, the halls and pavilions inside still appeared grand and imposing. Even the trees and rocks in the garden at the back seemed lush and vibrant. How could this resemble a declining family?"" Leng Zi Xing laughed and said, ""It's surprising that someone of your scholarly background doesn't understand! As the ancients said, 'A centipede dies but never falls down.' Although it's not as prosperous as it was in the past, compared to ordinary official families, it still has a different aura. Nowadays, with the population increasing and affairs growing, there are many who live in comfort and luxury, yet none who strategize and plan. Their daily expenses and extravagance cannot be curtailed or economized. While the external facade hasn't completely collapsed, the internal resources are nearly exhausted. This is a minor issue. There's an even bigger problem: who would have thought that in such a family of wealth and culture, a lineage of literature and poetry, the descendants would be less accomplished with each generation!"" Yu Cun, upon hearing this, was also puzzled and said, ""In such a family of poetry and propriety, how could there be a lack of proper education? I don't know about other families, but the Ning and Rong residences are known for their excellent child-rearing practices."""
"Zixing sighed and said, ""That's exactly what I'm talking about with these two families. Let me tell you: Back in the day, Duke Ningguo and Duke Rongguo were brothers born of the same mother. Duke Ning was the elder and had four sons. After Duke Ning passed away, Jia Daihua inherited the title and had two sons: the elder, Jia Fu, died at the age of eight or nine, leaving only the second son, Jia Jing, to inherit the title. Now, Jia Jing is solely interested in Taoism, obsessed with alchemy and refining mercury, and cares for nothing else. Fortunately, he left behind a son early on, named Jia Zhen. Because his father was so intent on becoming an immortal, he passed the title to Jia Zhen. His father refused to return to his ancestral home and instead mingled with Taoists outside the city. This Master Zhen has a son, who is only sixteen this year, named Jia Rong. Now, Old Master Jing doesn't care about anything. Master Zhen has no interest in studying and indulges in pleasure, turning the Ningguo Mansion upside down, with no one daring to control him. 

As for the Rong Mansion, listen to this: the strange events I mentioned earlier happened here. After Duke Rong passed away, his eldest son, Jia Daishan, inherited the title and married a lady from the noble Shi family of Jinling, giving birth to two sons: the elder, Jia She, and the younger, Jia Zheng. Now, Daishan has long since passed away, but the Dowager is still alive. The eldest son, Jia She, inherited the title, while the second son, Jia Zheng, had a passion for studying since childhood, and was deeply loved by his grandfather and father, who hoped he would achieve success through the imperial examinations. Unexpectedly, when Daishan was on his deathbed, he submitted a memorial, and the Emperor, out of compassion for his late minister, not only allowed the eldest son to inherit the title but also inquired about any other sons, granting this Old Master Zheng an official position as a matter of special favor, allowing him to study in the ministry. He has now been promoted to a senior official. Old Master Zheng's wife, Lady Wang, gave birth to a son named Jia Zhu, who entered school at fourteen, married, and had a child before he turned twenty, but then died of an illness. Their second child was a daughter, born on New Year's Day, which was quite remarkable; unexpectedly, the following year, another son was born, and even more astonishingly, he was born with a piece of colorful, translucent jade in his mouth, inscribed with many characters, so he was named Baoyu. Isn't that a strange and extraordinary event?"""
"Yu Village laughed and said, ""Truly peculiar. I fear this person has quite a significant background."" Zixing sneered and said, ""Everyone says so, which is why his grandmother cherished him like a treasure. When he was a year old, Old Master Zheng wanted to test his future ambitions by placing countless worldly items before him to see what he would choose. To everyone's surprise, he ignored everything and only reached for cosmetics and jewelry. Old Master Zheng was furious and said, 'He will become nothing but a debauched libertine!' Thus, he was greatly displeased. Yet, the Old Lady Shi still cherished him as if he were her own life. It's strange to say, now that he's seven or eight years old, although he's exceptionally mischievous, his intelligence and cleverness surpass that of a hundred others. His words as a child are also peculiar; he says, 'Girls are made of water, and men are made of mud. When I see girls, I feel refreshed; when I see men, I feel overwhelmed by their foul stench.' Isn't that amusing? He will undoubtedly become a womanizer!"" Yu Village, suddenly stern, quickly interrupted, ""Not so! It's a pity you don't know his true background. Old Master Zheng likely misjudged him as a mere lecher. Without extensive reading and understanding, along with the effort to investigate and comprehend the world, and the power to grasp profound truths, one cannot truly know."""
"Zixing, seeing the gravity of what was being said, hurriedly asked for clarification. Yu Cun replied, ""When Heaven and Earth create people, aside from the two types of great virtue and great evil, the rest are not significantly different. Those with great virtue are born in response to favorable times, while those with great evil are born in response to calamities. Favorable times bring about peace, while calamities bring about danger. Figures like Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, Zhou, Shao, Confucius, Mencius, Dong Zhongshu, Han Yu, Zhou Dunyi, Cheng Hao, Zhang Zai, and Zhu Xi were all born in response to favorable times. On the other hand, figures like Chiyou, Gonggong, Jie, Zhou, the First Emperor, Wang Mang, Cao Cao, Huan Wen, An Lushan, and Qin Hui were born in response to calamities. Those with great virtue govern and improve the world, while those with great evil disturb and disrupt it. Clear and bright spiritual essence is the righteous energy of Heaven and Earth, upheld by the virtuous; cruelty and perversity are the evil energy of Heaven and Earth, upheld by the wicked.

Now, in this era of prosperity and eternal fortune, a time of peace and inaction, the clear and bright spiritual essence is prevalent everywhere, from the court to the common people. The remaining spiritual essence, having no place to go, becomes sweet dew and gentle breeze, nourishing the world. The cruel and perverse evil energy cannot overflow under the bright sun and clear sky, so it condenses and fills the deep valleys and ravines. Occasionally stirred by the wind or disrupted by clouds, it may inadvertently leak out. When it encounters the passing spiritual essence, which does not tolerate evil, the two energies clash, much like wind, water, thunder, and lightning meeting underground. Unable to dissipate or yield, they must clash and erupt until exhausted. Thus, this energy must also be endowed to people, fully released before dispersing.

If men and women are born with this energy, they cannot become virtuous gentlemen if in high positions, nor can they become great villains if in low positions. Among millions, their intelligence and spiritual essence surpass others, yet their perversity and eccentricity are also unmatched. If born into noble and wealthy families, they become passionate and sentimental; if born into scholarly and humble families, they become reclusive scholars and high-minded individuals. Even if born into poor and lowly families, they cannot become mere servants or laborers, willingly subjected to mediocrity. They must become extraordinary performers or famous artists. Examples from past generations include Xu You, Tao Qian, Ruan Ji, Ji Kang, Liu Ling, the Wang and Xie families, Gu Huotou, Chen Houzhu, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Emperor Huizong of Song, Liu Tingzhi, Wen Feiqing, Mi Nangong, Shi Manqing, Liu Yiqing, Qin Shaoyou, and more recent figures like Ni Yunlin, Tang Bohu, Zhu Zhishan, as well as Li Guinian, Huang Fanchuo, Jing Xinmo, Zhuo Wenjun, Hongfu, Xue Tao, Cui Ying, and Chaoyun. These are all people who would be the same if placed in different circumstances."""
"Zixing said, ""According to you, 'if successful, one becomes a noble; if failed, one becomes a bandit.'"" Yu-cun replied, ""That's exactly what I mean. You may not know, since I was dismissed from my position, I've traveled across various provinces over the past two years and have encountered two extraordinary children. So, when you mentioned this Baoyu, I guessed that he might also be of the same kind. No need to look far, just within the city of Jinling, there's the Zhen family, with the imperial envoy and president of the Jinling Province Tiren Academy. Do you know them?"" Zixing said, ""Who doesn't know! The Zhen family and the Jia family are old relatives and have been friends for generations. The two families are extremely close. Even I have been in contact with them for more than just a day."""
"Yu Village laughed and said, ""Last year, when I was in Jinling, someone recommended me to teach at the Zhen family estate. I went in to see the situation, and who would have thought that despite their prominence, they were a wealthy family that valued etiquette, making it a rare place to teach. However, this one student, though just starting his education, was more mentally exhausting than preparing for the imperial exams. It's even more amusing when he said, 'I must have two daughters accompany me while I study; only then can I recognize the characters and understand them in my heart. Otherwise, I get confused.' He often told the servants around him, 'The words ""daughter"" are extremely noble and pure, more honorable than the sacred names of Amitabha or the Primordial Heavenly Venerable. You must not carelessly offend these two words with your filthy mouths. Whenever you need to mention them, you must first rinse your mouth with clean water and fragrant tea. If you make a mistake, you must face severe punishments like having your teeth knocked out or cheeks pierced.' His violent, impulsive, mischievous, and foolish behavior was extraordinary. But as soon as he finished his studies and met those daughters, he became gentle, peaceful, intelligent, and cultured, like a completely different person. Because of this, his father has severely punished him several times, but to no avail. Whenever he couldn't bear the pain of the beating, he would start calling out 'sister' and 'younger sister' indiscriminately. Later, I heard the daughters inside teasing him, 'Why do you keep calling your sisters when you're being beaten? Are you asking them to plead for mercy on your behalf? Aren't you ashamed?' His response was the best. He said, 'When the pain is intense, calling out ""sister"" or ""younger sister"" might relieve the pain, and indeed, after calling once, I felt no pain, so I discovered a secret method: whenever the pain is extreme, I call out to my sisters repeatedly.' Isn't that funny? Also, because his grandmother spoiled him without understanding, often blaming the teacher when the grandson was scolded, I resigned from the position. Now, I'm teaching at the Lin family, where the Imperial Salt Inspector resides. You see, such a child cannot uphold the foundation laid by his ancestors or follow the guidance of his mentors. It's a pity that his sisters are all quite exceptional."""
"Zixing said, ""Even in the Jia family, the three daughters currently there are quite remarkable. The eldest daughter of Lord Zheng is named Yuanchun. Due to her virtues, filial piety, talent, and moral conduct, she has been selected to enter the palace as a lady-in-waiting. The second young lady, named Yingchun, is the daughter of Lord She’s concubine. The third young lady, named Tanchun, is the illegitimate daughter of Lord Zheng. The fourth young lady, named Xichun, is the full sister of Master Zhen from the Ning Mansion. Because Lady Shi loves her granddaughters dearly, they all study together under their grandmother's care, and they are all said to be quite accomplished."" Yucun remarked, ""What's even more interesting is the custom of the Zhen family, where daughters are named after the male members, unlike other families that use flowery characters like 'Spring,' 'Red,' 'Fragrance,' or 'Jade.' How is it that the Jia family has also adopted this custom?"" Zixing replied, ""Not so. It is simply because the eldest young lady was born on the first day of the first lunar month, hence the name Yuanchun, and the others followed with the character 'Chun.' The previous generation also derived their names from their brothers. There is evidence of this: the wife of your esteemed employer, Mr. Lin, is the sister of Lords She and Zheng of the Rong Mansion, and her maiden name was Jia Min. If you don't believe it, you can inquire further when you return."" Yucun laughed and said, ""No wonder my female student always reads the character 'Min' as 'Mi' and often writes it with one or two strokes missing. I was somewhat puzzled by this. Now that I've heard you, it is undoubtedly for this reason. No wonder my female student's speech and behavior are different from other girls these days. I deduced that her mother must be extraordinary to have such a daughter. Now that I know she is the granddaughter of the Rong Mansion, it is not surprising, though it is a pity she passed away last month."" Zixing sighed, ""Among the four sisters, this one was the youngest, and now she's gone. None of the older generation of sisters is left. We can only wait and see what the future holds for the younger generation."""
"Yu Village said, ""Exactly. As we were discussing Lord Zheng, he already has a son born with a jade in his mouth, and there is also a weak grandson left by his eldest son. Is it possible that Lord She has no such offspring?"" Zixing replied, ""Lord Zheng, after having the son with the jade, had another child with his concubine, but it's uncertain whether this child is good or bad. As of now, he has two sons and a grandson, but who knows what the future holds. As for Lord She, he also has two sons. The elder one is named Jia Lian, who is now in his twenties. He married a niece of Lord Zheng's wife, Lady Wang, two years ago, thus strengthening family ties. This Master Lian currently holds the honorary title of Tongzhi, but he is not inclined toward studying. He is adept at navigating the ways of the world and is good at conversation, which is why he resides at his uncle Lord Zheng's house, helping with some household affairs. Unexpectedly, after marrying his esteemed wife, everyone praises her, and Master Lian seems to have taken a step back. They say she is extremely beautiful, her conversation is refreshing and sharp, and her mind is very meticulous, making her one in a million compared to men."""
"Yu Cun listened and laughed, saying, ""You see, my earlier words were not wrong. The people we just talked about might all be those who come from the same path, whether righteous or evil, who knows."" Zi Xing replied, ""Whether they are evil or righteous, we are just calculating others' accounts. You should have a drink too."" Yu Cun said, ""Indeed, I've been talking so much that I've ended up drinking a few more cups."" Zi Xing laughed and said, ""Talking about others' affairs is perfect with wine, so what if we drink a few more cups."" Yu Cun looked out the window and said, ""It's getting late, and we should be careful not to get locked out of the city. We can slowly enter the city and continue our conversation."" With that, the two of them got up and settled the wine bill. Just as they were about to leave, they heard someone calling from behind, ""Brother Yu Cun, congratulations! I've come to bring you good news."" Yu Cun quickly turned around to look—"
