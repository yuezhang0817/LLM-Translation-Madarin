"To document the history of my family, I once returned to the northeastern village of Gaomi to conduct extensive research. The focus of my investigation was the famous battle in which my father participated, where a Japanese major general was killed by the banks of the Moshui River. A 92-year-old woman from our village told me, ""In the northeastern village, with thousands of people, the formation was set by the Moshui River. Commander Yu stood at the front, raised his hand, and the sound of cannons echoed. The souls of the Japanese invaders scattered, falling across the plains. The leading woman, Dai Fenglian, with her beauty and clever strategies, arranged iron rakes in a chain to block the enemy's advance..."" The old woman's head was as bald as a clay pot, her face withered, and her dry hands were veined like the fibers of a loofah. She was a survivor of the great massacre during the Mid-Autumn Festival in August 1939. At that time, she had a sore on her foot and couldn't run, so her husband hid her in a sweet potato cellar, and by sheer luck, she survived. The Dai Fenglian mentioned in the rhythmic narrative was my grandmother's formal name. Hearing this, I was extremely excited. This indicated that the strategy of using iron rakes to block the retreat of enemy vehicles was devised by my grandmother, a woman. My grandmother should also be considered a pioneer in the resistance against the Japanese, a national hero."
"When it comes to my grandmother, the old lady has a lot to say. Her words are fragmented and scattered, like leaves blown across the ground by the wind. She talks about my grandmother's feet, the smallest in the village. She mentions that the spirits brewed at our home have a strong kick. When she talks about the Jiaoping Highway, her words become more coherent: ""When the road was being built on our land... the sorghum was waist-high... the invaders forced all the able-bodied people to work... everyone was lazy and sneaky... those two big black mules from your family were also taken away... the invaders built a stone bridge over the Moshui River... Luohan, your family's old long-term worker... he wasn't very proper with your grandmother, that's what people say... oh dear, your grandmother had quite a colorful past when she was young... your father was so capable, he killed someone at fifteen, bastards make good men, nine out of ten are not good... Luohan went to cut the mule's legs... got caught and was cut to pieces... the invaders were cruel, defecating in pots and urinating in basins. That year, when fetching water, what did I bring up? A human head, with a long braid..."""
"Grandpa Liu Luohan is an important figure in our family's history. Whether there was any affair between him and my grandmother can no longer be verified. Honestly, in my heart, I am reluctant to acknowledge this as a fact."
"Although I understand the reasoning, the words of the old lady Tao Guantou still made me feel embarrassed. I thought, since Grandpa Luohan treated my father like his own grandson, then he was like my great-grandfather; if this great-grandfather had an affair with my grandmother, wouldn't that be incest? This is actually just a wild thought. Because my grandmother was not Grandpa Luohan's daughter-in-law but his employer, Grandpa Luohan had only an economic relationship with my family, not a blood relationship. He was like a loyal old family member who embellished our family's history and undoubtedly added glory to it. Whether my grandmother loved him or whether he ever shared a bed with her is irrelevant to ethics. So what if she loved him? I am convinced that my grandmother dared to do anything she wanted. She was not only a hero of the anti-Japanese war but also a pioneer of personal liberation and a model of women's independence."
"I have consulted the county annals, which record: In the 27th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese army captured a total of 400,000 civilian laborers from Gaomi, Pingdu, and Jiaoxian to construct the Jiaoping Highway. Countless crops were destroyed. The villages on both sides of the highway were completely plundered of their mules and horses. A farmer named Liu Luohan sneaked in at night and injured numerous mule hooves and horse legs with a shovel, but he was caught. The next day, the Japanese army skinned and dismembered Liu Luohan at the horse tethering post as a public display. Liu showed no fear, cursing incessantly until his death."
