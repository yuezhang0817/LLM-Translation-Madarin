"It is indeed like this: when the Jiaoping Highway was being constructed to our area, the sorghum in the fields only grew to waist height. On the low dusty plain, which stretches seventy miles long and sixty miles wide, aside from being dotted with dozens of villages, crisscrossed by two rivers, and winding with dozens of rural dirt roads, it was all covered with sorghum swaying like green waves. On Baima Mountain to the north of the plain, the white horse-shaped boulder could be seen clearly from the edge of our village. The farmers hoeing the sorghum would look up to see the white horse and look down to see the black soil, with sweat dripping onto the crops, feeling deeply troubled in their hearts! Rumors spread that the Japanese were planning to build a road through the plain, and the villagers were already in a state of anxiety, anxiously awaiting the impending disaster."
The Japanese come as soon as they say they will.
"The Japanese soldiers, accompanied by puppet troops, came to our village to capture laborers and take mules and horses. My father was still asleep at the time. He was awakened by the noise coming from the distillery. My grandmother, holding my father's hand, ran on her small, bamboo-shoot-like feet to the distillery courtyard. At that time, our distillery courtyard had more than a dozen large vats filled with high-quality baijiu, and the aroma of the liquor wafted throughout the village. Two Japanese men in yellow uniforms stood in the courtyard with rifles fixed with bayonets. Two Chinese men in black uniforms, carrying guns, were about to untie two large black mules tethered to an ailanthus tree. Uncle Luohan repeatedly lunged at the short puppet soldier untying the ropes, but each time he was pushed back by the taller puppet soldier with the barrel of his gun. It was early summer, and Uncle Luohan was wearing only a thin shirt, his exposed chest covered with purplish-red circles from being jabbed by the gun barrel."
"Grandpa Luohan said, ""Brothers, let's talk things over calmly, let's talk things over calmly."""
"The tall collaborator said, ""You old beast, get out of the way."""
"Grandpa Luohan said, ""This is the master's livestock, it cannot be taken."""
"The collaborator said, ""If you keep making noise, I'll shoot your brother-in-law!"""
"The Japanese soldier held his gun, standing like a clay statue."
"As soon as my grandmother and father entered the courtyard, Grandpa Luo Han said, ""They want to take our mule."""
"Grandmother said, ""Sir, we are law-abiding citizens."""
The Japanese soldier squinted his eyes and smiled at Grandma.
"The short puppet soldier untied the mule and pulled it forcefully, but the mule stubbornly held its head high and refused to move. The tall puppet soldier went up and jabbed the mule's rear with his gun. The mule angrily raised its hooves, and the shiny horseshoes kicked up dirt, splattering it all over the puppet soldier's face."
"The tall puppet soldier pulled the gun's bolt, pointed the gun at Grandpa Luo Han, and shouted, ""Old bastard, you lead it, take it to the construction site."""
"Grandpa Luohan squatted on the ground, not saying a word."
"A Japanese soldier was holding a rifle, waving it in front of Grandpa Luohan. The soldier said, ""Uliwala yalaliwu!"" Grandpa Luohan, seeing the shiny bayonet waving in front of him, sat down on the ground with a thud. The soldier thrust the rifle forward, and the sharp edge of the bayonet made a white gash on Grandpa Luohan's bald scalp."
"Grandmother trembled and said, ""Uncle, you, take them away."""
"A Japanese soldier slowly approached my grandmother. My father noticed that this soldier was a young, handsome man with big, shiny black eyes. When he smiled, his upper lip curled up, revealing a set of yellow teeth. My grandmother stumbled backward, retreating behind Grandpa Luo Han. Blood was flowing from a wound on Grandpa Luo Han's head, staining his hair. Two Japanese soldiers approached, laughing. My grandmother pressed her hands on the blood in Grandpa Luo Han's hair, then smeared it across her face, tore her hair apart, opened her mouth wide, and started jumping around like a madwoman. She looked more like a ghost than a human. The Japanese soldiers stopped in their tracks, stunned. The short puppet soldier said, ""Taikun, this woman is very crazy."""
The enemy soldier grumbled and fired a shot at my grandmother's head. She sat on the ground and began to cry softly.
"The tall puppet soldier forced Grandpa Luohan up at gunpoint. Grandpa Luohan took the mule's reins from the short puppet soldier. The mule, with its head held high and legs trembling, followed Grandpa Luohan out of the courtyard. The street was in chaos with mules, horses, cattle, and sheep running around."
"Grandma wasn't crazy. As soon as the Japanese soldiers and collaborators left the hospital, she lifted the wooden lid of a jar and saw a horrifying bloody face reflected in the mirror-like surface of the sorghum liquor. Father saw tears streaming down Grandma's cheeks, and they turned red. Grandma washed her face with the liquor, turning the entire jar of liquor red."
"Old Luo Han and the mule were taken to the construction site. In the sorghum field, a section of road had already been cleared. The road south of the Moshui River was almost completed, with large and small vehicles squeezing onto the newly built road, carrying stones and yellow sand to be unloaded on the southern bank. There was only a small wooden bridge over the river, but the Japanese intended to build a large stone bridge there. On both sides of the road, large swathes of sorghum had been trampled flat, making the ground look like it was covered with a layer of green carpet. In the sorghum field on the northern bank, along the newly formed road made of black soil, dozens of mules and horses were pulling rollers, flattening two large areas in the sea of sorghum, disrupting the green curtain closely connected to the construction site. The mules and horses, led by people, walked back and forth in the sorghum field. The tender sorghum stalks broke and fell under the iron hooves, and the fallen, broken sorghum was repeatedly crushed by both grooved and smooth rollers. The various rollers and stone rollers turned a deep green, soaked by the sorghum juice. A strong scent of fresh seedlings enveloped the construction site."
"Grandpa Luo Han was forced to move stones from Henan to Hebei. Reluctantly, he handed the mule's reins to an old man with sunken eyes. The small wooden bridge wobbled as if it might collapse at any moment. After crossing the bridge, Grandpa Luo Han stood in Henan, where a Chinese man who looked like a foreman lightly tapped him on the head with a purplish-red cane and said, ""Go, move stones to Hebei."" Grandpa Luo Han wiped his eyes—the blood flowing from his head had soaked his eyebrows. He carried a medium-sized stone from Henan to Hebei. The old man who took the mule had not yet left, and Grandpa Luo Han said to him, ""Take care when using them; these two mules belong to my master."" The old man, with a numb expression, hung his head and led the mules into the mule and horse team clearing the path. The sunlight reflected off the shiny rump of the black mule. With blood still flowing from his head, Grandpa Luo Han squatted down, grabbed a handful of black soil, and pressed it onto his wound. The heavy, dull pain from his head radiated down to his toes, and he felt as if his head had split in two."
"Along the edges of the construction site stood sparsely armed Japanese soldiers and collaborators, while overseers holding rattan sticks roamed around the site like ghosts. Grandpa Luo Han walked on the construction site, and the laborers, seeing his head covered in blood and mud, were so shocked that their eyes trembled. Grandpa Luo Han picked up a piece of bridge stone and had just taken a few steps when he heard a sharp whistling wind behind him, followed by a long, burning pain on his back. He dropped the bridge stone and saw the overseer smiling at him. Grandpa Luo Han said, ""Officer, let's talk it over. Why do you hit people at the drop of a hat?"""
"The overseer smiled silently and raised the cane, striking it horizontally across his waist again. Grandpa Luohan felt as if this strike nearly split him in two, and two streams of hot tears welled up from his eye sockets. Blood rushed to his head, and the scab formed from blood and dirt on his head throbbed violently, as if it were about to burst open."
"Grandpa Luohan shouted, ""Officer!"""
The officer gave him another cane.
"Grandpa Luohan said, ""Officer, why are you hitting me?"""
"The officer shook the cane in his hand and said with a smile, ""Let's see if this teaches you a lesson, you son of a bitch."""
"Grandpa Luohan was choked with anger, his eyes blurred with tears. He picked up a large stone from the pile of rocks and staggered towards the small bridge. His head felt swollen, and his vision was a blur of white. The sharp edges of the stone dug into his belly and ribs, but he no longer felt the pain."
"The overseer stood still with a cane in hand, while Old Luo Han carried a stone, trembling with fear as he walked past him. The overseer lashed Old Luo Han on the neck with the cane again. Old Luo Han fell forward, clutching the large stone, and knelt on the ground. The stone crushed his hands, and his chin was battered and bloody from hitting the stone. Beaten into a daze, Old Luo Han began to cry like a confused child. At that moment, a purple-red flame slowly ignited in his blank mind."
"He struggled to pull his hand out from under the rock and stood up, his back slightly hunched like an old, scrawny cat ready to pounce."
"A middle-aged man, who appeared to be in his early forties, approached the supervisor with a broad smile on his face. He took a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket, pulled one out, and offered it to the supervisor. The supervisor took the cigarette with his mouth and waited for the man to light it for him."
"The middle-aged person said, ""Sir, there's no need to get angry over this worthless piece of wood."""
The overseer exhaled smoke from his nostrils without saying a word. The old man noticed his nicotine-stained fingers gripping the cane were twitching urgently.
"The middle-aged man slipped the pack of cigarettes into the overseer's pocket. The overseer seemed completely unaware, grunted, pressed his hand over the pocket, and turned to leave."
"""Hey buddy, are you new here?"" the middle-aged man asked."
Grandpa Luohan said yes.
"He asked, ""Didn't you give him a meeting gift?"""
"Grandpa Luohan said, ""Unreasonable, dogs! Unreasonable, they forcibly brought me here."""
"The middle-aged man said, ""Give him some money, or a pack of cigarettes, anything is fine. We don't hit the diligent, we don't hit the lazy, we only hit those who are blind to the situation."" With that, the middle-aged man confidently joined the group of migrant workers."
"For the entire morning, Grandpa Luohan seemed soulless, relentlessly moving stones. The scab on his head was exposed to the sunlight, causing a dry, hard pain. His hands were a bloody mess. The bone in his chin was injured, causing saliva to continuously drip out. The purplish-red flame flickered in his mind, sometimes strong, sometimes weak, but never extinguishing."
"At noon, a dirt-colored car bumped along the barely passable road ahead. He vaguely heard a sharp whistle and watched as the half-exhausted workers staggered towards the car. Sitting on the ground, he had no thoughts and didn't care to know what the arrival of the car was about. Only the cluster of purplish-red flames leapt intensely, buzzing in his ears."
"A middle-aged man came over, gave him a hand, and said, ""Hey brother, let's go, it's time to eat. Come and try some Japanese rice!"""
Grandpa Luohan stood up and followed the middle-aged man.
"They unloaded several large buckets of snow-white rice from the car, along with a large basket holding a blue and white porcelain bowl. Next to the buckets stood a thin Chinese man wielding a brass spoon; beside the basket stood a fat Chinese man holding a stack of bowls. As each person approached, he handed them a bowl, and the brass spoon simultaneously scooped rice into it. The crowd around the car devoured the food ravenously, using their hands instead of chopsticks."
"The overseer turned around again, holding a cane, with that calm smile on his face. A flame flared up in Grandpa Luo Han's mind, illuminating the memories he had cast aside with perfect clarity. He recalled the nightmare-like experiences of the past half day. Armed Japanese soldiers and collaborators also gathered around, eating around a white tin bucket. A wolfhound with cropped ears and a long face sat behind the bucket, its tongue hanging out as it watched the laborers on this side."
"Luo Han Daye counted the dozen or so Japanese soldiers and puppet troops gathered around the barrel eating, and the thought of escaping began to form in his mind. Run, as long as he got into the sorghum fields, those bastards wouldn't be able to catch him. Sweat flowed warmly from the soles of his feet. Ever since the idea of escaping took root, his heart had been restless. What was hidden behind the calm, smiling face of the overseer, Chi Teng? As soon as Luo Han Daye saw that smile, his mind immediately became muddled."
"The laborers did not have enough to eat. The chubby Chinese man took back the foreign bowl. The laborers licked their lips, staring eagerly at the few grains of rice left in the empty buckets, but no one dared to touch them. On the north bank, a mule let out a hoarse cry. Grandpa Luohan recognized it as our black mule. In the newly cleared area, the mules and horses were tied to stone rollers or stone cylinders. Sorghum lay scattered everywhere like corpses. The mules and horses listlessly nibbled on the crushed and flattened sorghum stalks and leaves."
"In the afternoon, a young man in his twenties took advantage of the overseer's inattention and dashed towards the sorghum field like a flash. A bullet caught up with him. He lay motionless at the edge of the sorghum field."
"The sun was setting in the west, and that tan-colored car came again. Grandpa Luo Han finished that spoonful of rice. His stomach, accustomed to sorghum rice, resolutely rejected this moldy-smelling white rice. But he still forced himself to swallow it despite the spasms in his throat. The urge to run was growing stronger. He was thinking about the village more than ten miles away, where his fragrant courtyard awaited him. When the Japanese came, his distilling partners all fled, and the steaming distillation pot went cold. He was even more concerned about my grandmother and my father. The warmth my grandmother provided him by the stack of sorghum leaves was something he would never forget."
"After dinner, the laborers were herded into a large enclosure made of wooden poles. The enclosure was covered with several tarps. The cedar poles were connected with iron wires as thick as mung beans. The gate of the enclosure was welded from iron rods about half a handle thick. The Japanese soldiers and the puppet troops stayed in two separate tents, which were located several dozen steps away from the enclosure. A dog was tied at the entrance of the Japanese soldiers' tent. At the entrance of the enclosure, there was a tall pole with two lanterns hanging from it. The Japanese soldiers and puppet troops took turns standing guard and patrolling. The mules and horses were all tied together in the ruins of a sorghum field to the west of the enclosure, where dozens of hitching posts were planted."
"The stench inside the enclosure was overwhelming. Some people were snoring, while others were urinating into the tin bucket in the corner of the fence, the sound of urine hitting the bucket's wall like pearls falling onto a jade plate. The light from the mast lamp dimly penetrated the enclosure. The long shadow of the roving sentry occasionally flickered in the lamplight."
"The night deepened, and a chill pervaded the enclosure. Grandpa Luo Han couldn't sleep. He still wanted to escape. The sound of the guard's footsteps echoed around the fence. Grandpa Luo Han lay still, afraid to move, and eventually drifted into a hazy sleep. In his dream, he felt a sharp knife piercing his head and a branding iron in his hand. When he awoke, he was drenched in sweat, and his pants were wet with urine. A sharp crowing of a rooster came from a distant village. Mules and horses stamped their hooves and snorted. Through the worn-out tarp, a few sneaky stars peeked through."
"The middle-aged man who had helped Grandpa Luo Han during the day quietly sat up. Even in the dim light, Grandpa Luo Han could still see his eyes, which were like two fireballs. Grandpa Luo Han knew that the middle-aged man had an extraordinary background, so he lay still, observing his movements."
"A middle-aged man knelt at the gate of the fence, raising his arms very slowly. Grandpa Luohan watched his back and his head, which carried an air of mystery. The middle-aged man gathered his strength and suddenly turned to the side, grabbing two iron bars as if drawing a bow to shoot an arrow. A dark green light shot from his eyes, and when it touched objects, it seemed to make a faint rustling sound. The two iron bars silently opened. More light and starlight streamed in from outside the fence gate, illuminating a tattered shoe with an open mouth, belonging to someone unknown. A patrolling sentry turned around. Grandpa Luohan saw a shadow dart out of the fence, and the enemy sentry let out a gasp before silently collapsing with the support of the middle-aged man's iron arms. The middle-aged man picked up the enemy's rifle and quietly disappeared."
"It took Grandpa Luo Han quite a while to understand what had happened in front of him. The middle-aged man turned out to be a highly skilled martial arts hero. The hero cleared a path for him, urging him to run. Grandpa Luo Han cautiously crawled out through the hole. The dead enemy lay on his back, one leg still twitching."
"Luo Han Daye crawled into the sorghum field, straightened up, and walked along the furrow, trying to avoid making any noise as he headed towards the Ink River embankment. The three stars were at their peak, and the darkness before dawn had descended. The stars shone brightly in the Ink River. Standing uneasily on the embankment, Luo Han Daye felt a bone-chilling cold, his teeth chattering frequently, and the pain in his jawbone spreading to his cheeks and ears, merging with the throbbing, pus-like pain at the top of his head. The cool air, mixed with the juice of sorghum, entered his nostrils, lungs, and stomach. Those two ghostly mast lights shone in the fog, and the black silhouette of the cedar fence loomed like a giant tomb. Luo Han Daye could hardly believe he had escaped so easily. His feet led him to the decaying little wooden bridge, where fish splashed in the water, the stream babbled, and a shooting star streaked across the sky. It seemed as if nothing had happened, nothing at all. In fact, Luo Han Daye could have escaped back to the village, hidden away, healed his wounds, and continued living. However, as he walked on the wooden bridge, he heard a restless mule bray hoarsely on the south bank. For the sake of the mule, Luo Han Daye turned back, leading to a tragic and heroic scene."
"The mules and horses were tied to dozens of wooden stakes not far from the fence. Beneath them, the air was filled with the stench of urine and feces. The horses snorted, and the mules gnawed on the stakes; the horses chewed on sorghum stalks, while the mules defecated. Grandpa Luohan stumbled forward, making his way into the herd of mules and horses. He caught the familiar scent of the two big black mules from my family and saw their familiar figures. He rushed forward, trying to rescue his troubled companions. The mules, these irrational creatures, quickly turned their backs and kicked up their hind legs. Grandpa Luohan murmured, ""Black mule, black mule, let's run away together!"" The mules, in a fit of rage, spun left and right, guarding their territory. They no longer recognized their owner. Grandpa Luohan was unaware that the fresh and old scent of blood on him, along with his fresh and old wounds, had changed him. His mind was in turmoil as he stepped forward, and a mule kicked him in the hip bone. The old man flew sideways and lay on the ground, half of his body numb. The mule continued to kick, its hooves flashing like a crescent moon. Grandpa Luohan's hip bone felt hot and swollen, with a heavy sense of burden. He tried to get up, fell, and tried again. The thin-voiced rooster in the village crowed once more. Darkness gradually faded, and the three stars shone more brilliantly, illuminating the shiny rumps and eyes of the mules."
"""Two beasts!"""
"Grandpa Luohan, with a surge of anger in his heart, staggered around looking for a sharp tool. At the construction site of the irrigation canal, he found a sharp shovel. He walked and cursed without restraint, forgetting the people and dogs a hundred steps away. He felt free, as fear was the only thing that took away his freedom. The reddish glow in the east was rising and scattering simultaneously, and the sorghum field before dawn was so silent it seemed ready to explode at any moment. Grandpa Luohan, facing the morning glow, walked towards the two large black mules. He harbored deep hatred for the black mules. The mules stood still, and Grandpa Luohan leveled the shovel and fiercely struck at one of the black mule's hind legs. A cool shadow fell on the mule's hind leg. The mule staggered twice, then stood firm, letting out a rough, wild, astonished, and angry neigh from its head. Immediately, the injured mule raised its hindquarters high, splattering hot blood like raindrops, drenching Grandpa Luohan's face. Seizing the opportunity, Grandpa Luohan struck the mule's other hind leg. The black mule sighed, its hindquarters gradually collapsing, and suddenly sat on the ground, its two front legs still standing, its neck pulled straight by the reins, its mouth appealing to the now gray-blue sky. The shovel was pinned under the mule's heavy hindquarters, and Grandpa Luohan squatted down. He used all his strength to pull the shovel out, feeling the blade firmly embedded in the mule's leg bone. The other black mule, dumbfounded, watched its fallen companion, whimpering as if crying or begging for mercy."
"Grandpa Luohan leveled the iron shovel and advanced towards it. It retreated forcefully, nearly snapping the reins, causing the wooden stake to creak and crack. In its fist-sized eyes, a dark blue light shimmered."
"Are you scared? You beast! Where's your arrogance now? You beast! You ungrateful traitor, you treacherous scoundrel! You foreign-collaborating bastard!"
"Grandpa Luo Han angrily shouted and swung a shovel at the long, rectangular face of the black mule. The shovel struck a wooden stake, and he wiggled the handle up and down, left and right, to pull the blade out. The black mule struggled, its hind legs bent like a bow, and its bare tail swept the ground with a scraping sound. Grandpa Luo Han aimed at the mule's face, and with a loud smack, the shovel hit the broad forehead of the mule. The sturdy skull collided with the blade, sending a tremor through the handle that made Grandpa Luo Han's arms tingle with numbness. The black mule remained silent, its hooves moving erratically, crossing and stumbling until it could no longer stand. With a crash, it fell like a thick wall collapsing. The reins snapped, leaving one end hanging from the stake and the other curled by the mule's face. Grandpa Luo Han stood silently with his arms hanging down, the smooth handle of the shovel leaning against the mule's head, pointing skyward. In the distance, dogs barked and people clamored as the sky brightened. From the sorghum fields to the east, a blood-red sunrise emerged, its light shining directly into Grandpa Luo Han's half-open, dark mouth."
