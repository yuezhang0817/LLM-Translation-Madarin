"On the ninth day of the eighth month in the lunar calendar of 1939, my father, who was just over fourteen and had the makings of a bandit, joined the ranks of the later world-renowned legendary hero Commander Yu Zhan'ao to ambush the enemy's convoy on the Jiaoping Highway. My grandmother, wearing a padded jacket, accompanied them to the edge of the village. Commander Yu said, ""Stop here."" So my grandmother stopped. She said to my father, ""Douguan, listen to your godfather."" My father didn't respond; he looked at my grandmother's tall figure and inhaled the warm fragrance emanating from her padded jacket, suddenly feeling a chill. He shivered, and his stomach growled. Commander Yu patted my father's head and said, ""Let's go, godson."""
"The world was in chaos, with the scenery appearing vague and indistinct. The clattering footsteps of the troop had already echoed far into the distance. A blue and white mist hung before the father's eyes, obstructing his view; he could hear the footsteps of the troop but could not see their forms or shadows. The father clung tightly to Commander Yu's coat, moving his legs quickly. The grandmother seemed to drift further away like a receding shore, while the mist surged closer like turbulent seawater. The father held onto Commander Yu as if grasping the railing of a ship."
"The father thus rushed towards the wordless bluestone tombstone that belonged to him, standing tall in the crimson sorghum fields of his hometown. On his grave, the withered grass rustled. Once, a bare-bottomed boy led a snow-white goat here. The goat leisurely nibbled on the grass atop the grave, while the boy stood on the tombstone, angrily urinated, and then sang loudly: ""The sorghum is red—the Japanese have come—fellow countrymen, get ready—fire the guns and cannons—"""
"Some say that the shepherd boy is me, but I don't know if it's true. I once had an extreme love for the Northeast Gaomi Township, and I once had an extreme hatred for it. As I grew up and studied Marxism diligently, I finally realized: the Northeast Gaomi Township is undoubtedly the most beautiful and the ugliest, the most transcendent and the most mundane, the most sacred and the most sordid, the most heroic and the most despicable, the place where people drink the most and love the most on earth. My fellow countrymen living on this land enjoy eating sorghum, which is planted in large quantities every year. In the deep autumn of August, the endless fields of sorghum turn into a vast sea of blood-red, with the sorghum shining brilliantly, yet also appearing poignant and charming, stirring with love. The autumn wind is bleak, the sun is strong, and the sky is a tile-blue with plump white clouds drifting by, casting purplish-red shadows on the sorghum. Teams of dark red figures weave through the sorghum stalks, pulling nets, day in and day out for decades. They have committed murder and robbery, and they have loyally served the country. They have performed scenes of heroic and tragic dramas, making us, the unworthy descendants who are still alive, pale in comparison. As I progress, I genuinely feel a sense of degeneration."
"After leaving the village, the group proceeded along a narrow dirt road, with the sound of footsteps mingling with the rustling of broken grass by the roadside. The fog was extraordinarily thick, lively, and ever-changing. On my father's face, countless tiny droplets of water coalesced into large beads, and a tuft of his hair stuck to his scalp. The faint mint scent and the slightly bitter-sweet aroma of ripe sorghum drifting from the sorghum fields on both sides of the road were smells my father was long accustomed to; they were neither new nor surprising to him. However, during this march through the fog, my father detected a novel, fishy-sweet scent interwoven with hues of yellow and red. This aroma subtly emerged from the mint and sorghum scents, evoking a very distant memory deep within my father's soul."
"Seven days later, on the fifteenth of August, it was the Mid-Autumn Festival. A bright moon slowly rose, illuminating the fields of sorghum standing solemnly. The sorghum heads were bathed in moonlight, as if dipped in mercury, shimmering brightly. Under the fragmented shadows of the moon, my father smelled a sweet and fishy scent, far stronger than anything he had ever experienced. At that time, Commander Yu was holding his hand, walking through the sorghum fields. Over three hundred villagers lay dead, their bodies piled up, their blood irrigating a large area of sorghum, turning the black soil beneath into a muddy mess, making it difficult for them to move. The sweet and fishy smell was suffocating. A pack of dogs, drawn by the scent of human flesh, sat in the sorghum field, their eyes fixed intently on my father and Commander Yu. Commander Yu pulled out his revolver, and with a flick of his wrist, two pairs of dog eyes were extinguished; with another flick, two more pairs of eyes were gone. The pack scattered, retreating to a distance, growling and watching the corpses greedily. The sweet and fishy smell grew even stronger. Commander Yu shouted, ""Japanese dogs! Sons of bitches, the Japanese!"" He fired all his bullets at the pack, and the dogs disappeared without a trace. Commander Yu said to my father, ""Let's go, son!"" The old and the young, they walked into the depths of the sorghum fields, bathed in moonlight. The pervasive sweet and fishy smell soaked into my father's soul, accompanying him through the even more intense and brutal years that followed."
"The stalks and leaves of the sorghum sizzled in the mist, and the bright clamor of the Ink River, slowly flowing through the low-lying plain, fluctuated in intensity and distance. Catching up with the team, the sound of footsteps and heavy breathing echoed around my father. Someone's gunstock accidentally hit another's, and someone stepped on a dead person's skull or something. The person in front of my father started coughing, a cough that was very familiar. Hearing the cough, my father thought of his two large ears that would flush with blood when excited. The thin, translucent ears, full of blood vessels, were the most noticeable feature on Wang Wenyi's head. He was small in stature, with a large head nestled between his raised shoulders. My father strained to see through the thick fog and spotted Wang Wenyi's head bobbing as he coughed. My father recalled how pitiful Wang Wenyi's head looked when he was beaten during drills. Back then, he had just joined Commander Yu's team, and Deputy Officer Ren would shout at him and the other members on the drill field: ""Turn right—"" Wang Wenyi would stomp joyfully, unsure of where to turn. Deputy Officer Ren whipped him on the buttocks, and he cried out, ""Mother of my child!"" His expression was a mix of crying and laughing. The children watching from outside the short wall burst into laughter."
Commander Yu kicked Wang Weny's butt.
"""What are you coughing about?"""
"""Commander..."" Wang Wenyin said, holding back a cough, ""my throat feels itchy..."""
"""Even if it itches, don't cough! If you expose our position, I'll have your head!"""
"""Yes, Commander,"" Wang Weny answered, followed by another bout of coughing."
"The father noticed that Commander Yu's hand had released its grip from the back of Wang Wenyi's neck. The father also felt that there were two purple marks, like ripe grapes, left on Wang Wenyi's neck. In Wang Wenyi's deep blue, anxious eyes, there was a flash of gratitude and grievance."
"Soon, the group entered the sorghum field. My father instinctively felt that the group was heading southeast. The dirt road we had just walked on was the only road leading directly from the village to the banks of the Ink River. This narrow dirt road appeared pale during the day. It was originally made of rich black soil, but after being trampled for so long, the black color had settled to the bottom. Countless petal-shaped hoof prints of cattle and sheep, as well as semicircular hoof prints of mules and donkeys, overlapped on the road. The droppings of horses, mules, and donkeys resembled withered apples, cow dung looked like worm-eaten pancakes, and sheep droppings scattered like fallen black beans. My father often walked this road, and later, during his difficult years in a Japanese charcoal kiln, this road frequently flashed before his eyes. My father did not know how many romantic and tragic dramas my grandmother had starred in on this dirt road, but I do. My father also did not know that on the black soil shaded by the sorghum, my grandmother's smooth, jade-like white body once lay, but I know."
"After turning into the sorghum field, the fog appeared even more stagnant, with greater density and less sense of movement. When people's bodies and the objects they carried collided with the sorghum stalks, heavy droplets of water fell with a rustling sound, accompanied by the plaintive creaking of the sorghum. The water droplets were icy and refreshing, with a delicious taste. As my father tilted his face upward, a large droplet accurately landed in his mouth. He saw the heavy heads of sorghum swaying in the gentle fog. The dew-laden, flexible leaves of the sorghum brushed against his clothes and cheeks. The small breeze stirred by the swaying sorghum made a brief assault above his head, and the sound of the Ink River's flowing water grew increasingly loud."
"Here is the translation of the provided Chinese text:

Father used to play in the Ink River, and his swimming skills seemed innate. Grandma said he was more eager to see water than his own mother. At the age of five, Father could dive like a little duck, with his pink bottom facing the sky and his feet raised high. Father knew that the silt at the bottom of the Ink River was dark and shiny, as soft as grease. On the damp riverbank, gray-green reeds and goose-green plantains grew in clusters, along with ground-hugging wild kudzu vines and upright elderberry plants. The silt on the riverbank was covered with the delicate tracks of crabs. When the autumn wind rose and the weather cooled, flocks of wild geese flew south, sometimes forming a line, sometimes a V-shape, and so on. The sorghum turned red, the west wind howled, and the crabs' legs itched. At night, groups of crabs, the size of horseshoes, crawled onto the riverbank to forage in the grass. Crabs liked to eat fresh cow dung and decaying animal carcasses. Father listened to the sound of the river, recalling autumn nights of the past when he went crab-catching by the river with our old family worker, Grandpa Liu Luohan. The night was grape-gray, the golden wind swept through the river, and the sapphire sky was deep and boundless, with green stars exceptionally bright. The Big Dipper—associated with death, the Southern Dipper—associated with life, the octagonal glass well—missing a brick, the anxious Cowherd ready to hang himself, and the sorrowful Weaver Girl ready to jump into the river... all hung overhead. Grandpa Liu Luohan worked for our family for decades, overseeing all operations of our family’s distillery. Father followed closely behind Grandpa Luohan, just like following his own grandfather."
"The father's heart, disturbed by the fog, lit up with a lantern made of four glass panels. The kerosene smoke seeped out from the perforated tin cover of the lantern. The light was weak, illuminating only a five or six-meter radius of darkness. The river water flowed into the light, appearing as charmingly yellow as ripe apricots, but the charm was fleeting as it flowed past, with the river's water reflecting the stars above. The father and Uncle Luo Han, draped in straw raincoats, sat by the lantern, listening to the river's low, mournful wail—a very low wail. Occasionally, the excited calls of foxes seeking mates echoed from the endless sorghum fields on both sides of the river. Attracted by the light, crabs gathered towards the lantern's glow. The father and Uncle Luo Han sat quietly, attentively listening to the world's secret whispers, as the muddy smell from the riverbed wafted up in waves. Groups of crabs surrounded them, forming a restless circle. The father felt anxious, eager to act, but Uncle Luo Han held him by the shoulder. ""Don't rush!"" Uncle Luo Han said, ""You can't drink hot sticky porridge in a hurry."" The father suppressed his excitement and remained still. The crabs crawled into the light and stopped, linking head to tail, covering the ground. A sheen of blue crab shells glistened, pairs of stalk-like eyes protruded from sunken sockets. From mouths hidden beneath slanted faces, they blew strings of colorful bubbles. The crabs, spitting colorful foam, seemed to challenge the humans, causing the long hair of the father's large straw raincoat to stand on end. Uncle Luo Han said, ""Grab them!"" The father sprang into action at the word, and together with Uncle Luo Han, they rushed forward, each grabbing two corners of a fine-mesh net already spread on the ground, lifting a mass of crabs and revealing the riverbank beneath. The father and Uncle Luo Han tied the corners and tossed the net aside, then swiftly and skillfully lifted another net. Each net was so heavy, it was impossible to tell how many hundreds or thousands of crabs were caught."
"After the father followed the team into the sorghum field, he moved erratically like a crab, his feet and legs not avoiding gaps, causing the sorghum stalks to sway and topple. His hand always clutched the corner of Commander Yu's clothing, half walking on his own and half being led by Commander Yu. He even felt a bit drowsy, his neck stiff, and his eyes dry and dull. The father thought that as long as he followed Grandpa Luo Han to the Moshui River, there was no reason to return empty-handed. He was tired of eating crabs, and so was Grandma. They found them tasteless yet too precious to waste, so Grandpa Luo Han would chop the crabs into pieces with a sharp knife, grind them in a tofu mill, add salt, and store them in jars to make crab paste, which they ate year-round. If they couldn't finish it, it would spoil, and the spoiled paste was used to feed poppies. I heard that Grandma smoked opium but wasn't addicted, so she always looked radiant and refreshed. The poppies fed with crabs grew large and lush, with pink, red, and white flowers mingling, exuding a strong fragrance. The black soil of my hometown was inherently fertile, resulting in abundant produce and excellent human stock. The people were naturally robust and vigorous, a reflection of my hometown's spirit. The white eels from the Moshui River were as plump as meat sticks, with only one bone from head to tail. They were dull-minded and swallowed hooks readily. The father remembered that Grandpa Luo Han had died last year on the Jiaoping Highway. His body was cut into pieces, scattered here and there. The skin on his torso was peeled off, and the flesh twitched and bounced like a skinned frog. Whenever the father thought of Grandpa Luo Han's corpse, a chill ran down his spine. He also recalled a night about seven or eight years ago when Grandma got drunk in the courtyard of our family’s distillery. There was a stack of sorghum leaves, and Grandma leaned against it, hugging Grandpa Luo Han's shoulder, murmuring, ""Uncle... don't go, if not for my sake, then for Dou Guan's, stay, if you want me... I'll give myself to you... you're like a father to me..."" The father remembered Grandpa Luo Han pushing Grandma aside and staggering into the mule shed to mix feed for the mules. Our family owned two big black mules and ran a sorghum liquor distillery, making us the wealthiest in the village. Grandpa Luo Han didn't leave and continued to lead our business until the Japanese took our two big black mules for labor on the construction site of the Jiaoping Highway."
"At this moment, a long bray of a donkey came from the village left behind by his father and the others. His father perked up and opened his eyes, but all he saw was the semi-solid, semi-transparent mist. The tall stalks of sorghum formed dense fences, vaguely hidden behind the vapor, stretching endlessly row after row. His father had forgotten how long he had been walking in the sorghum field; his mind had long lingered on the distant, bustling, fertile river, and in the memories of the past. He didn't even know why he was rushing and squeezing through the dreamlike, ocean-like sorghum field. His father had lost his bearings. He had once gotten lost in the sorghum field the year before, but eventually found his way out, guided by the sound of the river. Now, he listened again for the river's guidance and quickly understood that the group was heading slightly southeast, towards the river. With the direction clear, his father realized they were going to set an ambush, to fight the Japanese, to kill, like killing dogs. He knew the group was heading southeast and would soon reach the Jiao-Ping Highway, which ran north-south, dividing the vast lowland plain in half and connecting the county towns of Jiaoxian and Pingdu. This highway was built by the Japanese and their lackeys, who forced the locals to construct it with whips and bayonets."
"The rustling of the sorghum grew more frequent and intense due to people's exhaustion and fatigue. Dew continuously fell, soaking everyone's scalp and neck. Wang Wenyin coughed incessantly, refusing to change even after being repeatedly scolded by Commander Yu. My father felt that the road was near, as the shadow of the road swayed dizzily before his eyes. Unknowingly, gaps began to appear in the sea of fog, and stalks of sorghum, drenched by dew, gazed at my father with melancholy from within the foggy voids. My father also looked at them with reverence. Suddenly, he had an epiphany, realizing that they were all living spirits. They were rooted in the black soil, absorbing the essence of the sun and moon, nourished by rain and dew, knowledgeable of the heavens above and the earth below. From the color of the sorghum, my father guessed that the sun had turned the horizon, obscured by the sorghum, into a pitifully bright red."
"Suddenly, an unexpected event occurred. First, the father heard a sharp whistle by his ear, followed by the sound of something bursting in front of him."
"Commander Yu shouted loudly, ""Who fired the shot? Brother-in-law, who fired the shot?"""
"The father heard a bullet pierce through the thick fog, pass through the sorghum leaves and stalks, and a sorghum head fell to the ground. For a moment, everyone held their breath in silence. The bullet screamed all the way, not knowing where it landed. The fragrant gunpowder smoke dispersed into the fog. Wang Weny screamed in agony, ""Commander—I have no head—Commander—I have no head—"""
"Commander Yu was momentarily stunned, then kicked Wang Weny i and said, ""Damn it! How can something without a head still talk!"""
"Commander Yu left my father behind and went to the front of the troops. Wang Wenying was still wailing. My father moved closer and got a clear look at Wang Wenying's strangely shaped face. There was a deep blue substance flowing on his cheek. My father reached out to touch it and felt a sticky, hot liquid. He smelled a scent similar to the silt of the Ink River, but much fresher. It overpowered the faint aroma of mint and the bittersweet scent of sorghum. It awakened my father's increasingly vivid memories, stringing together the silt of the Ink River, the black soil beneath the sorghum, the past that never truly dies, and the present that can never be held onto. Sometimes, everything seems to exude the scent of human blood."
"""Uncle,"" my father said, ""Uncle, you're wounded."""
"""Douguan, you are Douguan, right? Can you check if Uncle's head is still on his neck?"""
"""Hey, uncle, you look fine, it's just that your ear is bleeding."""
"Wang Weny stretched out his hand to touch his ear and found it covered in blood. After a scream, he collapsed: ""Commander, I've been hit! I've been hit, I've been hit."""
"Commander Yu returned from the front, crouched down, grabbed Wang Weny's neck, and said in a low voice, ""Don't shout. If you shout again, I'll shoot you!"""
Wang Wenyin didn't dare to call out.
"""Where are you hurt?"" Commander Yu asked."
"""Ears..."" Wang Weny cried as he spoke."
"Commander Yu pulled out a piece of white cloth resembling a bundle from his waist, tore it in half with a ripping sound, and handed it to Wang Wenyin, saying, ""Cover it for now, don't make a sound, follow along, and we'll bandage it once we reach the road."""
"Commander Yu called out again, ""Officer Dou."" The father responded, and Commander Yu took his hand and walked away. Wang Wenyiyi followed behind, grumbling."
"The gunshot just now was caused by the big mute who was carrying a rake and clearing the way in front; he accidentally fell, causing the rifle on his back to discharge. The mute is an old friend of Commander Yu, a rough-and-tumble hero who once ate ""jia bing"" in the sorghum fields. One of his feet was injured in the womb, causing him to limp, but he moves very quickly. My father is somewhat afraid of him."
"The thick fog around dawn finally dispersed as Commander Yu's troops stepped onto the Jiaoping Highway. In my hometown, August is a foggy season, perhaps due to the low-lying terrain and damp soil. Once on the highway, my father immediately felt agile and light, his steps brisk and strong, so he let go of Commander Yu's coat. Wang Wenyin, with a white cloth covering his bleeding ear, wore a tearful expression. Commander Yu clumsily bandaged his ear, wrapping half of his head as well. Wang Wenyin grimaced in pain."
"Commander Yu said, ""You have quite a life!"""
"Wang Weny said, ""I've lost all my blood, I can't go!"""
"Commander Yu said, ""Nonsense, a mosquito bite is nothing more than this. Have you forgotten about your three sons?"""
"Wang Weny lowered his head and mumbled, ""I haven't forgotten, I haven't forgotten."""
"He carried a long-barreled shotgun on his back, with a blood-red stock. A flat iron box for holding gunpowder hung diagonally at his hip."
"The remaining fog retreated into the sorghum fields. The main road was covered with coarse sand, showing no traces of cattle or horses, nor any human footprints. In contrast to the dense sorghum on both sides of the road, the highway appeared desolate, absurd, and ominous. Father had long known that Commander Yu's troop consisted of no more than forty people, including the deaf, mute, lame, and crippled. Yet, when these people stayed in the village, they caused such chaos that it seemed as if the entire village was filled with soldiers. The troop gathered on the main road, with over thirty people huddled together like a frozen snake. Their weapons were of varying lengths, including homemade cannons, bird guns, and old Hanyang rifles. Brothers Fang Liu and Fang Qi carried a large pole gun capable of shooting small weights. The mute carried a rectangular harrow with twenty-six iron spikes used for leveling land, and three other team members each carried one as well. At that time, Father did not understand what an ambush was, nor why they needed to carry four harrows with iron spikes for it."
