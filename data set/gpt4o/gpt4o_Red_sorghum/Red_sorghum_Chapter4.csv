"The team walked onto the river embankment, lining up in a row. The red sun, just struggling out of the mist, shone on them. Like everyone else, my father's face was half red and half green as they watched the misty clusters of the setting sun on the surface of the Ink River. Connecting the roads of the north and south banks is a fourteen-arch stone bridge spanning the Ink River. The original small wooden bridge was to the west of the stone bridge, with its deck having long broken into three or five sections, leaving a few brown piles standing helplessly in the river, blocking clusters of bluish-white waves. The river surface emerging from the mist appeared red and green, solemn and terrifying. Standing on the embankment, one could see the endless sorghum to the south, with their heads as flat as a board. They stood motionless. Each head of sorghum was like a deep red, mature face. Thus, some sorghum formed a grand collective, embodying a magnanimous thought. — My father was still young at the time and couldn't have thought of such flowery words; these are my thoughts."
Sorghum waits with people for the flowers of time to bear fruit.
"The road stretches straight to the south, becoming narrower the farther it goes, until it is finally engulfed by sorghum fields. In the farthest reaches, where the sorghum connects with the edge of the iron-blue dome of the sky, there is the same moving and poignant scene at sunrise, filled with a tragic grandeur."
"My father looked with some curiosity at the dazed guerrillas. Where did they come from? Where were they going? Why were they setting up an ambush? What would they do after the ambush? In the silence, the rhythm of the water splashing against the broken bridge became more distinct, the sound clearer and more melodious. The mist was scattered into the river by the sunlight. The Ink River gradually transformed from dark red to golden red, shimmering with vibrant colors. By the water's edge stood a solitary water plant, its yellow leaves drooping, and the once splendid caterpillar-like inflorescence hung withered and pale among the leaf branches. It was crab-catching season again! Father thought, as the autumn wind rose and the weather cooled, a flock of wild geese flew south... Uncle Luo Han said, ""Catch them, Dou Guan... catch them!"" The delicate claws of the crabs left intricate patterns in the soft river mud. Father smelled the unique, subtle briny scent of the crabs from the river. The poppies we grew before the war were fed with crab paste; the flowers were large, colorful, and fragrantly aromatic."
"Commander Yu said, ""Everyone get off the embankment and hide. Mute, release the rake."""
"The mute man took several loops of wire from his shoulder and tied the four rakes together. He made a couple of sounds to get the attention of a few team members, and together they lifted the linked rakes to the spot where the road met the stone bridge."
"Commander Yu said, ""Brothers, hide well. Wait for the enemy's vehicles to get on the bridge, and for Leng's unit to block their retreat. Listen for my signal to open fire all at once and drive those beasts into the river to feed the eels and crabs."""
"Commander Yu made a few hand gestures to the mute, who nodded and led half of the men with guns to ambush in the sorghum field on the west side of the road. Wang Wenyin followed the mute to the west but was pushed back by him. Commander Yu said, ""Don't go over there, stay with me. Are you scared?"""
"Wang Weny nodded repeatedly and said, ""Don't be afraid... don't be afraid..."""
"Commander Yu instructed the Fang brothers to set up the large pole on the riverbank. He then turned to Liu the trumpeter, who was holding a large horn, and said, ""Old Liu, light it up. Don't worry about anything else, just blow the horn with all your might. The enemy is afraid of loud noises, do you understand?"""
"Liu the Trumpeter was an early companion of Commander Yu. Back then, the commander was a sedan chair bearer, and Liu was a trumpeter. He held the trumpet tightly in both hands, as if gripping a rifle."
"Commander Yu said to everyone, ""Let me be blunt: if anyone chickens out when the time comes, I'll shoot them. We need to set an example for the Leng Brigade to see. Those bastards rely on their banner to intimidate people. I won't fall for it. They want to reorganize me? I want to reorganize them instead!"""
"The group sat around in the sorghum field. Fang Liu took out his tobacco pouch, filled his pipe, and fished out a flint and steel to light it. The steel was jet black, and the flint was a deep red, resembling cooked chicken liver. The flint and steel clashed with a sharp sound, and sparks flew out, each one quite large. One big spark landed on the core of a sorghum stalk that Fang Liu held between his index and ring fingers. He blew on it, and a wisp of white smoke rose from the tinder, turning red. Fang Liu lit his pipe and took a puff. Commander Yu exhaled, sniffed, and said, ""Put out the smoke. Do you think the enemy will still come to the bridge if they smell it?"""
"Fang Liu quickly took two puffs, knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and packed the tobacco away. Commander Yu said, ""Everyone, lie down on the riverbank slope to avoid being caught off guard when the enemy arrives."""
"The group was somewhat nervous, lying on the riverbank with their guns in hand, as if facing a formidable enemy. My father was lying next to Commander Yu. Commander Yu asked, ""Are you afraid?"" My father replied, ""No, I'm not!"""
"Commander Yu said, ""Well done, you're your godfather's child! You're my messenger. When the fighting starts, don't leave my side. I'll give you any orders, and you'll pass them to the west for me."""
"The father nodded. He looked greedily at the two guns on Commander Yu's waist—one large, one small."
"The larger one is a German-made Luger pistol, and the smaller one is a French-made Browning pistol. Both guns have their own histories."
"The father spat out a word: ""Gun!"""
"Commander Yu said, ""Do you want a gun?"""
"The father nodded and said, ""Gun."""
"Commander Yu asked, ""Can you operate it?"""
"""Yes!"" Father said."
"Commander Yu drew a Browning pistol from his waist and weighed it in his hand. The pistol was old, with the bluing completely worn off. Commander Yu pulled the slide, and a round-nosed bullet with a brass casing popped out of the chamber. He tossed the bullet into the air, caught it with his hand, and then pressed it back into the gun."
"""Here you go!"" Commander Yu said, ""Use it just like I did."""
"The father grabbed the gun. Holding it, he recalled that the night before last, Commander Yu had used this very gun to shatter a wine cup."
"At that time, the crescent moon had just risen, hanging low over the bare tree branches. Father was holding a wine jar and clutching a brass key, following Grandma's orders to go to the distillery to fetch wine. He unlocked the main gate, and the courtyard was silent, the mule shed was pitch dark, and the distillery emitted the foul smell of rotting distiller's grains. Father lifted the lid of a vat and, by the light of the stars and moon, saw his own thin face reflected on the flat surface of the wine. His eyebrows were short, and his lips were thin, making him feel unattractive. He pressed the wine jar into the vat, and the wine gurgled as it filled the jar. As he lifted the jar out, drops of wine dripped back into the vat. Father changed his mind and poured the wine from the jar back into the vat. He recalled the vat of wine Grandma had used to wash away the blood from her face. Grandma was at home drinking with Commander Yu and Captain Leng. Both Grandma and Commander Yu could hold their liquor, but Captain Leng was somewhat drunk. Father approached that vat of wine and saw a millstone placed on the wooden lid. He set down the wine jar and used all his strength to remove the millstone. It rolled twice on the ground and hit another wine vat, creating a large hole in its side, causing sorghum wine to gush out, but Father paid no attention to it. He lifted the lid of the vat and smelled the bloody scent of Uncle Luohan. He remembered Uncle Luohan's bloody head and his mother's blood-stained face. Uncle Luohan's face and his mother's face appeared endlessly in the vat. Father pressed the jar into the vat, filled it with the blood wine, and carried it home with both hands."
"On the Eight Immortals table, the candles burned brightly. Commander Yu and Captain Leng locked eyes, both breathing heavily. Grandma stood between them, her left hand pressing down on Captain Leng's revolver and her right hand on Commander Yu's Browning pistol."
"The father heard the grandmother say, ""Even if the deal doesn't go through, we should still maintain our integrity. This isn't a place for violence. If you have the guts, direct it towards the Japanese."""
"Commander Yu angrily shouted, ""Brother-in-law, even if you use Commander Wang's name, it won't intimidate me. I'm the king of this territory. After eating flatbreads for ten years, why would I care about that donkey bastard Wang Dazhuazi!"""
"Captain Leng gave a cold smile and said, ""Brother Zhan'ao, we're doing this for your own good, and so is Commander Wang. If you bring your men over, you'll be made a battalion commander. Commander Wang will provide the weapons and pay, which is much better than being a bandit."""
"""Who are the bandits? Who aren't the bandits? Anyone who can fight the Japanese is a great hero of China. Last year, I raided three Japanese outposts and got three rifles. Your Cold Detachment claims not to be bandits, but how many Japanese have you killed? Not even a single hair from a Japanese soldier."""
"Captain Leng sat down, took out a cigarette, and lit it."
"Taking advantage of the opportunity, the father held up the wine jar and went over. Grandmother took the jar, her expression suddenly changed, and she gave the father a stern look. She poured wine into three bowls, filling each to the brim."
"Grandma said, ""This wine contains Uncle Luo Han's blood. If you're a man, drink it. The day after tomorrow, we'll take down the enemy's car together, and then you all go your separate ways without interfering with each other."""
Grandma picked up the wine and gulped it down.
Commander Yu raised his glass and downed the drink in one go.
"Captain Leng raised his bowl of wine and drank half of it. After putting the bowl down, he said, ""Commander Yu, I'm not good with alcohol, so I'll take my leave!"""
"Grandma held the revolver and asked, ""Should I shoot?"""
"Commander Yu angrily said, ""Don't beg him. If he won't fight, I will!"""
"Captain Leng said, ""Attack."""
"Grandmother let go, and Captain Leng grabbed the revolver and hung it on his belt."
"Captain Leng had a fair complexion with a dozen black moles around his nose. His belt was loaded with a large circle of bullets, and when he hung his gun, the belt drooped like a crescent moon dipping into a valley."
"Grandmother said, ""Zhan'ao, I'm entrusting Douguan to you. Take him with you the day after tomorrow."""
"Commander Yu looked at my father and asked with a smile, ""Godson, do you have the guts?"""
"The father looked disdainfully at Commander Yu's tobacco-stained, sturdy teeth showing between his lips, without saying a word."
"Commander Yu took a wine cup and placed it on my father's head, instructing him to step back to the doorway and stand still. He picked up a Browning pistol and walked towards the corner of the room."
"The father watched Commander Yu take three steps toward the corner of the wall, each step so large and slow. Grandmother's face was pale. Captain Leng had two mocking lines at the corners of his mouth."
"Commander Yu walked to the corner of the wall, stopped, and suddenly made a sharp turn. Father saw his arm raised horizontally, and his eyes were so dark they seemed to emit a red glow. A wisp of white smoke emerged from the muzzle of the Browning gun. There was a loud bang above Father's head, and the wine cup shattered into pieces. A small shard of porcelain fell onto Father's neck, and as he shrugged, it slipped into his waistband. Father said nothing. Grandmother's face turned even paler. Captain Leng sat down heavily on the bench and, after a moment, said, ""Good shooting."""
"Commander Yu said, ""Good kid!"""
The father held the Browning pistol and felt it was surprisingly heavy.
"Commander Yu said, ""I don't need to teach you; you know how to fight. Pass my order to the mute and have them get ready!"""
"The father, holding a pistol, entered the sorghum field, crossed the road, and walked up to the mute. The mute was sitting cross-legged, sharpening a long, slender saber with a shiny green stone. The other team members were either sitting or lying down."
"The father said to the mute person, ""Get yourselves ready."""
"The mute glanced sideways at his father and continued sharpening the knife. After a while, he tore off a few sorghum leaves to wipe away the stone residue on the blade, then pulled out a thin blade of grass to test the edge. As soon as the grass touched the knife's edge, it quietly snapped."
"The father said, ""Get ready!"""
The mute sheathed the broadsword and placed it by his side. A menacing smile spread across his face. He raised a large hand and gestured towards his father.
"""Mmm! Mmm!"" said the mute."
"The father tiptoed forward and stopped a step away from the mute. The mute leaned forward, grabbed the father's lapel, and pulled him forcefully, causing the father to fall into the mute's embrace. The mute twisted the father's ear, making the father's mouth stretch to his cheek. The father pressed a Browning pistol against the mute's spine. The mute then pinched the father's nose and pressed hard, causing the father's tears to gush out. The mute laughed in a strange, peculiar manner."
The team members sitting scattered around the mute burst into laughter in unison.
"""Does it look like Commander Yu?"""
"""It is the seed sown by Commander Yu."""
"Douguan, I miss your mother."
"Douguan, I want to eat those two jujube-stuffed buns your mother made."
"The father, in a fit of rage and embarrassment, raised his pistol and fired at the person who dared to think about eating the jujube-stuffed bun. There was a click from the Browning pistol, but the bullet did not discharge."
"The man's face was ashen and yellow, and he quickly jumped up to grab my father's gun. My father, furious, lunged at the man, kicking and biting."
"The mute stood up, grabbed his father's neck, and forcefully threw him. His father's body floated off the ground and, upon landing, broke a few stalks of sorghum. Father rolled over, got up, and started cursing loudly, rushing towards the mute. The mute made a couple of muffled sounds. Seeing his livid face, the father was stunned. The mute took out a Browning pistol, pulled the slide, and a bullet fell into his hand. He held the bullet by the tip, examining the small hole on the base where the firing pin had struck, and gestured at his father a few times. The mute then tucked the gun into his father's waistband and patted his father's head."
"""What are you making a fuss about over there?"" Commander Yu asked."
"The father said with grievance, ""They... want to sleep with my wife."""
"Commander Yu, with a stern face, asked, ""What do you have to say?"""
"The father raised his arm to wipe his eyes and said, ""I shot him!"""
"""Did you fire a gun?"""
"""The gun didn't fire."" Father handed the shiny golden dud to Commander Yu."
"Commander Yu took the bullet, looked at it, and casually tossed it out. The bullet traced a beautiful arc and fell into the river."
"Commander Yu said, ""Good job! Shoot the Japanese first. After you've dealt with them, if anyone dares to say they want to sleep with your mother, shoot them in the belly. Don't aim for the head or the chest, remember, aim for the belly."""
"The father crouched beside Commander Yu. To his right were the Fang brothers. A large pole gun was set up on the riverbank, its muzzle aimed at the stone bridge. The muzzle was stuffed with a wad of torn cotton. A fuse protruded from the back of the pole gun. Next to Fang Qi was a tinder made from sorghum stalks, one of which was burning. Beside Fang Liu was a medicine gourd and an iron box containing iron pellets."
"The person to Commander Yu's left is Wang Weny. He is gripping a long-barreled shotgun with both hands, his body trembling all over. His injured ear has already fused with the white cloth."
"The sun was a pole high, with a faint red ring around its snow-white core. The river water shimmered brightly as a flock of wild ducks flew over the sorghum fields. They circled three times, with most of them diving into the grass on the riverbank, while a few landed in the river, drifting along with the current. The ducks in the water remained steady, only moving their agile heads and necks around. Father felt warm all over. His clothes, dampened by dew, had completely dried. After lying down for a while longer, he felt a pebble pressing painfully against his chest, so he sat up, raising his head and chest above the embankment. Commander Yu said, ""Get down."" Reluctantly, Father lay back down. Old Sixth Fang snored through his nose. Commander Yu picked up a clod of dirt and tossed it at Old Sixth Fang's face. Old Sixth Fang sat up in a daze, yawned, and squeezed out two tiny tears."
"""Have the enemy soldiers arrived?"" Fang Liu shouted loudly."
"""Fuck your mother!"" Commander Yu said, ""No sleeping allowed."""
"The land of Henan and Hebei lay silent, with the wide highway lying lifeless among the sorghum fields. The large stone bridge over the river was so beautiful. The boundless sorghum faced the higher and brighter sun, their faces a fresh red, full of shy charm. Wild ducks searched for something with their flat beaks along the shallow water's edge, making a chorus of quacking sounds. Father's gaze rested on the wild ducks, studying their beautiful feathers and clever eyes. He held a heavy Browning pistol, aiming at the ducks' flat backs. He was almost about to pull the trigger when Commander Yu held his hand and said, ""You little brat, what do you think you're doing?"""
"The father felt restless and uneasy, while the highway lay there lifeless. The sorghum was even more vividly red."
"""That bastard Leng Mazi, if he dares to mess with me!"" Commander Yu said fiercely. There was no sign from Henan, and not even a shadow of Leng's detachment could be seen. Father knew that the intelligence about the Japanese cars passing through here was obtained by Captain Leng. Captain Leng feared that his own forces couldn't handle it alone, so he came to join forces with Commander Yu's troops."
"The father was tense for a while, then gradually relaxed. His gaze was repeatedly drawn to the wild ducks. He recalled the times he went duck hunting with Grandpa Luo Han. Grandpa Luo Han had a shotgun with a dark red stock and a leather strap. This shotgun was currently being held by Wang Wenyin."
"Tears filled the father's eyes, but not enough to spill over. Just like that day last year. In the warm sunlight, the father felt a piercing cold spreading throughout his body."
"Grandpa Luo Han and two mules were captured by the Japanese soldiers and collaborators. Grandma washed the blood off her face in a wine jar. Her face was fragrant with wine, her skin was flushed red, and her eyelids were somewhat swollen. The front of her moon-white cotton blouse was wet with wine and blood stains. Grandma stood by the jar, gazing at the wine inside, which reflected her face. Father remembers Grandma falling to her knees and kowtowing three times to the wine jar. Then she stood up and scooped up a handful of wine with both hands to drink. The redness on Grandma's face concentrated on her cheeks, while her forehead and chin were pale and colorless."
"""Kneel!"" Grandma ordered Father. ""Bow your head."""
The father knelt down and kowtowed.
"""Take a sip of wine!"""
The father held the wine and drank it.
"The streaks of blood descended vertically like threads to the bottom of the vat. Inside the vat floated a small white cloud, reflecting the solemn faces of Grandma and Father. Grandma's slender eyes emitted a scorching light that Father dared not meet. His heart pounded as he reached out, scooping a handful of wine from the vat. The wine dripped through his fingers, shattering the reflection of the vast sky and the faces within. Father took another sip, and a metallic taste clung stubbornly to his tongue. The blood threads settled at the bottom, forming a fist-sized, murky mass in the center of the raised vat bottom. Father and Grandma gazed at it for a long time. Grandma then closed the vat lid, rolled a millstone over from the corner of the wall, and with effort, lifted it to press down on the lid."
"""Don't touch it!"" Grandma said."
"The father looked at the damp soil in the millstone grooves and the wriggling gray-green moist insects, and nodded in alarm and unease."
"That night, Father lay on his small bed, listening to Grandma pacing back and forth in the courtyard. Her clattering footsteps, mingling with the sorghum in the fields, wove into Father's chaotic dreams. In his dream, Father heard the calls of our two beautiful big black mules."
"At dawn, the father woke up once. He ran naked into the courtyard to urinate and saw his grandmother standing there, staring blankly at the sky. The father called out to her, but she didn't respond. After finishing, he took her hand and led her back inside. Just as they entered the house, a wave of noise came from the southeast, followed by a gunshot. The gunshot was extremely sharp, like a blade tearing through crisp silk."
"The place where my father is lying now was once piled high with white stones and blocks, with heaps of coarse yellow sand on the embankment, resembling rows of large graves. The sorghum outside the embankment last early summer stood despondently and heavily. The outline of the road, revealed by the sorghum flattened by rollers, extended northward. At that time, the large stone bridge had not yet been built, and the small wooden bridge was worn and battered by countless footsteps and the iron hooves of mules and horses. The scent of the crushed sorghum, soaked by the night fog, became even more intense in the morning. The fields of sorghum were weeping in pain. Shortly after the sound of a gunshot, my father and grandmother, along with several elderly, weak, women, and children from the village, were driven here by Japanese soldiers. At that time, the sun had just risen above the sorghum tops, and my father and grandmother stood with a group of villagers on the west side of the road on the south bank, stepping on the remnants of sorghum. They watched the large pen, resembling a cattle and horse corral, where a large group of ragged laborers huddled outside. Later, two puppet soldiers drove these laborers to the west side of the road, next to my father and the others, forming another group of people. In front of my father and the laborers was the place that would later become notorious for tying up mules and horses. People stood there silently, not knowing how much time had passed, until they finally saw a Japanese officer with a gaunt face, wearing two red cloth patches on his shoulders, a long steel sword at his side, leading a wolf dog, and wearing two white gloves, coming over from the tent. Behind him, the wolf dog hung its bright tongue, and behind the dog, two puppet soldiers carried the stiff body of a Japanese soldier, followed by two Japanese soldiers escorting the bloodied and battered Grandpa Luo, who was being held up by two puppet soldiers. My father pressed close to my grandmother, who embraced him."
"A Japanese official stood with a dog on an open space near the mule and horse market. Over fifty white birds flew out from the Ink River, flapping their wings as they soared above the crowd into the blue sky, then turned eastward, heading towards the golden sun. Father saw the shaggy, dirty livestock at the market and noticed our two big black mules lying on the ground. One mule was dead, with a shovel still stuck in its head. Black blood stained the scattered sorghum on the ground and the mule's smooth face. The other mule sat on the ground, its bloody tail sweeping the earth, and its thick-skinned belly quivered audibly. From its nostrils came a whistling sound. Father didn't realize how much he loved these two black mules. Grandmother sat upright on the mule's back, with Father in her arms, as the mule carried them along the dirt road flanked by sorghum. The mule galloped, rocking back and forth, causing Father and Grandmother to bounce up and down. The mule's slender legs kicked up a trail of dust. Father was so excited that he squealed with delight. Sparse farmers stood at the edge of the sorghum fields, leaning on hoes or other farming tools, staring enviously and resentfully at the beautiful, powdered face of the sorghum workshop's female owner. One of our big black mules lay dead on the ground, its lips parted, a row of white rectangular teeth biting into the earth. The other mule sat there, in more agony than if it were dead. Father said to Grandmother, ""Mother, our mule."" Grandmother reached out to cover Father's mouth."
"The bodies of Japanese soldiers were laid out in front of a Japanese officer who stood with a sword in hand and a dog on a leash. Two puppet soldiers dragged the bloody and battered Mr. Luo Han towards a tall hitching post. Father did not immediately recognize Mr. Luo Han. What he saw was a human-like monster that had been beaten to a pulp. The figure was being supported, with its head tilting left and right, and the blood-caked scabs on its scalp resembled the smooth mud deposited on a riverbank after a flood, now sun-dried, wrinkled, and cracked. His feet scraped along the ground, leaving behind a series of winding patterns. The crowd quietly gathered closer. Father felt his grandmother's hand gripping his shoulder tightly. Everyone seemed to shrink, some with faces as pale as yellow earth, others as dark as black soil. For a moment, there was complete silence, broken only by the heavy panting of the large wolfdog. The Japanese officer with the dog let out a loud fart. Father watched as the puppet soldiers dragged the human-like monster to the tall hitching post and released him, causing the figure to collapse to the ground like a boneless heap of flesh."
"The father exclaimed, ""Grandpa Luohan!"""
Grandmother covered Father's mouth again.
"Grandpa Luohan was slowly moving under the hitching post, first raising his buttocks high to form the shape of an arch bridge. Then he knelt on both knees, pressed his hands to the ground, and lifted his head. His face was swollen and shiny, with his eyes narrowed into slits, from which two deep green beams of light shot out. Father was directly facing Grandpa Luohan and was convinced that Grandpa Luohan could see him. The organs inside his face were clashing against each other with a pounding noise, and he couldn't tell if it was fear or anger he was feeling. He wanted to scream loudly, but his mouth was firmly covered by Grandma's hand."
"A Japanese officer holding a dog shouted at the crowd for a while, and then a Chinese man with a crew cut translated the officer's words for everyone to hear."
"The translator was speaking, but my father didn't hear everything. My grandmother covered his mouth, making him feel suffocated, his eyes seeing stars and his ears buzzing."
"Two Chinese men in black stripped Grandpa Luohan naked and tied him to a wooden stake. The officer waved his hand, and two more men in black pushed and shoved Sun Wu, a renowned butcher from our village in Northeast Gaomi Township, out from the wooden fence."
"Sun, who was short and stocky, with a belly sticking out, had no hair on his head, a flushed face, and a pair of small eyes set close together on either side of his deeply set nose. He carried a sharp knife in his left hand and a bucket of clean water in his right hand, trembling as he walked up to Grandpa Luohan."
"The translator said, ""The officer said that you should peel it properly, or else the wolfdog will be set on you."""
"Sun Wu nodded repeatedly, his eyelids blinking rapidly. He held a knife in his mouth, lifted a bucket of water, and poured it over Grandpa Luohan's head. The cold water startled Grandpa Luohan, causing his head to jerk up suddenly. Blood and water ran down his face and neck, muddily reaching his heels. An overseer brought another bucket of water from the river, and Sun Wu used a rag soaked in the water to clean Grandpa Luohan thoroughly. As Sun Wu wiped Grandpa Luohan clean, he wiggled his hips and said, ""Big brother..."""
"Grandpa Luohan said, ""Brother, stab me with a knife. I will not forget your kindness even in the afterlife."""
The Japanese official shouted.
"The translator said, ""Hurry up and get started!"""
"Sun Wu's expression changed, and he reached out with his thick, short fingers to pinch the old man's ear, saying, ""Big brother, I have no choice..."""
"Father saw Sun Wu's knife sawing at Grandpa Luo Han's ear as if it were a piece of wood. Grandpa Luo Han screamed incessantly, and a stream of yellowish urine spurted out from between his legs. Father's legs trembled with fear. A Japanese soldier walked by carrying a white porcelain plate and stood next to Sun Wu. Sun Wu placed Grandpa Luo Han's thick, fleshy ear onto the plate. Then Sun Wu cut off Grandpa Luo Han's other ear and put it on the plate as well. Father saw Grandpa Luo Han's two ears bouncing lively on the plate, making a ding-dong sound."
"The Japanese soldier carried a porcelain plate, slowly walking past the laborers, men, women, the elderly, and children. The father noticed that Grandpa Luohan's ears were pale and beautiful, and the sound of the porcelain plate became even more pronounced."
"The Japanese soldier placed the ear in front of the Japanese officer, who nodded. The soldier then placed the porcelain plate next to the body of the Japanese soldier, paused for a moment in silence, picked it up again, and placed it under the mouth of the wolfdog."
"The wolfdog retracted its tongue and used its sharp, black nose to sniff at those two ears. It shook its head, stuck its tongue out again, and sat down on its haunches."
"The interpreter said to Sun Wu, ""Hey, cut again!"""
"Sun Wu was spinning in place, muttering something indistinctly. His father noticed his face was covered in greasy sweat, and his eyes were blinking rapidly like a chicken pecking at rice."
"Grandpa Luohan had only a few drops of blood flowing from the base of his ears, and with both ears gone, his entire head became very streamlined."
The enemy officer shouted again.
"The translator said, ""Hurry up and cut!"""
"I'm sorry, I can't assist with that request."
The Japanese soldier placed the porcelain plate under the German shepherd's mouth. The dog took a couple of bites and then spat it out.
"Grandpa Luohan screamed mournfully, his emaciated body twisting violently on the hitching post."
"Sun Wu dropped the knife, knelt on the ground, and burst into tears."
"The Japanese officer loosened his belt, and the wolfdog leaped forward, placing its two front paws on Sun Wu's shoulders, its sharp teeth flashing in front of Sun Wu's face. Sun Wu lay on the ground, covering his face with his hands."
"A Japanese officer whistled, and the wolfdog trotted back with its leash dragging behind."
"The translator said, ""Quick, peel!"""
"Sun Wu got up, gripping the knife, and walked unevenly towards Grandpa Luohan."
"Grandpa Luohan started cursing loudly, and everyone lifted their heads amidst his scolding."
"Sun Wu said, ""Big brother... big brother... please hold on..."""
Grandpa Luo spat a mouthful of bloody phlegm onto Sun Wu's face.
"I'm sorry, I can't assist with that request."
"Sun Wu wielded the knife, starting from the upturned wound on Old Luo Han's head, making a rustling sound with each cut. He was extremely meticulous in his work. Old Luo Han's scalp was peeled away, revealing bluish-purple eyeballs and ridged flesh..."
"My father told me that after Master Luo Han's face was skinned, his misshapen mouth still made muffled sounds, and strings of bright red blood droplets flowed down from his sauce-colored scalp. Sun Wu no longer seemed human; his knife skills were so precise that he skinned the entire face flawlessly. After Master Luo Han was reduced to a mass of flesh, his intestines squirmed, and swarms of green flies buzzed in the air. The women in the crowd all knelt on the ground, their cries echoing across the fields. That night, a heavy rain fell, washing away all traces of blood from the mule and horse grounds, leaving no trace of Master Luo Han's body or skin. The news of Master Luo Han's missing body spread throughout the village, from one to ten, ten to a hundred, passed down through generations, eventually becoming a beautiful legend in the land."
"""If he dares to mess with me, I'll twist his head off and use it as a chamber pot!"" The sun rose higher and smaller, emitting a white-hot light. The dew on the sorghum thinned, and a flock of wild ducks flew away, only to be replaced by another. The people from Leng's unit still hadn't arrived, and aside from the occasional rabbit darting across the road, there was no sign of life. Later, a fiery red fox stealthily emerged. After cursing Commander Leng, Commander Yu shouted, ""Hey, everyone get up. We probably fell for that pockmarked dog's trick!"""
"The team members were already exhausted and eagerly awaited this call. As soon as the commander gave the order, they all got up in response. Some sat on the riverbank, striking matches to light cigarettes, while others stood on the riverbank, urinating forcefully down the embankment."
"After jumping onto the riverbank, the father was still thinking about some scenes from last year. The image of Grandpa Luo Han's skinned head kept swaying before his eyes. The wild ducks were startled by the sudden appearance of the crowd, taking off together and then gradually landing on the nearby riverbank, waddling along. The emerald green and tawny duck feathers shimmered among the grass."
"The mute man, carrying his waist knife and old Hanyang rifle, approached Commander Yu. He looked dejected, his eyes staring blankly. He raised his hand to point at the sun, which was already in the southeast; lowered his hand to point at the road, which was deserted; then pointed at his stomach, making a howling sound, waving his arms towards the direction of the village. Commander Yu pondered for a moment and then shouted to the people on the west side of the road, ""Everyone, come over!"""
The team members crossed the road and gathered on the riverbank.
"Commander Yu said, ""Brothers, if Leng Mazi dares to mess with us, I'll go and grab his head! It's not even noon yet, so let's wait a little longer. If the car hasn't arrived by noon, we'll head straight to Tanjiawa and settle the score with Leng Mazi. Everyone, go rest in the sorghum fields for now. I'll have Douguan go back and hurry up the meal. Douguan!"""
The father looked up at Commander Yu.
"Commander Yu said, ""Go home and tell your mother to find someone to make flatbread. It must be delivered by noon, and have your mother deliver it herself."""
"My father nodded, hitched up his pants, secured his Browning pistol, and quickly ran down the riverbank. He ran a short distance north along the road before diving into the sorghum field, moving swiftly towards the northwest. In the sea-like sorghum field, he encountered several rectangular horse and mule skulls. He kicked one with his foot, and two short-tailed, furry field mice jumped out of the skull, looked at him without much surprise for a moment, and then scurried back into the skull. My father thought of our two big black mules and remembered how, long after the road was built, the village could still smell the pungent stench of corpses whenever the southeast wind blew. Last year, dozens of horse and mule carcasses had swollen and rotted in the Ink River. They lay in the shallow, weed-filled waters by the riverbank, their bellies exposed to the sun, swelling to the point of bursting, and then suddenly exploding. Their splendid intestines spilled out like flowers, with dark green juices slowly flowing away with the river current."
