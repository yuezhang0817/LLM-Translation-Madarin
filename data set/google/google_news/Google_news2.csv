Editorial: Why is this interview with Ren Zhengfei so popular?
"On June 10, the People's Daily published an exclusive interview with Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei on the front page.When talking about facing external blockade and suppression, Ren Zhengfei said, ""Don't think about the difficulties, just do it, and move forward step by step."" He also called on the whole society to support theoretical scientific research that ""will take decades or hundreds of years to see the contribution"" and to maintain strategic patience with theoretical scientists.As a Chinese entrepreneur, Ren Zhengfei's words show his confidence in ""unswervingly running his own affairs well"", his pattern of ""opening up will make us more progress"", and his determination to anchor the forefront of technological development and adhere to long-termism, which aroused widespread resonance in society."
"As we all know, Huawei's chips and 5G technology have long been suppressed by sanctions from the United States and some other Western countries.Not long ago, Huawei's Ascend chips were ""warned"" by the United States about the risks of using them for no reason.But Huawei ""moved forward step by step"" and overcame difficulties one by one.This reflects a value consensus that is increasingly gathering in Chinese society. From the once ""stuck"" semiconductor field to the most competitive technological frontiers such as artificial intelligence and basic scientific research, China's leap-forward progress has never been based on temporary passion, but on the long-termism of anchoring goals and achieving success over time.It is precisely by insisting on doing ""difficult but right things"" that Huawei has the confidence to ""survive"" in the face of suppression and blockade, and to break through in ""stuck"" fields such as chips and operating systems.This is also a vivid manifestation of ""unswervingly handling one's own affairs."""
"""The more open the country is, the more progress we will make."" It should be noted that in the current environment, the development and growth of private enterprises represented by Huawei cannot be separated from the support of China's large and complete industrial system, infrastructure, talent supply and institutional guarantees, as well as the construction of the country's market-oriented, legal and international business environment.In the past seven years, the central government has held two private enterprise symposiums to help enterprises solve problems, boost confidence, and draw up a blueprint for development.Last month, the ""Private Economy Promotion Law of the People's Republic of China"" was officially implemented. Its 9 chapters and 78 articles continue to optimize the development environment of the private economy from multiple levels such as fairness, standardization, services, and guarantees, creating many ""firsts.""The ""two unwavering principles"" are written into law and repeatedly emphasized in Party documents, giving private enterprises and entrepreneurs long-term institutional confidence.The resonance of the country's top-level design and the development needs of enterprises is the most solid support for breaking the blockade and resisting risks."
"From the increasing emphasis on R&D investment from all walks of life in recent years, we can also see the strong social consensus of ""unswervingly running our own affairs.""According to a report released by Huawei's official website in April this year, Huawei's R&D investment in 2024 will be 179.7 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 9.1%, accounting for 20.8% of sales revenue.According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, my country's total social research and experimental development (R&D) funding will exceed 3.6 trillion yuan in 2024, reaching 3.613 billion yuan, an increase of 8.3% over the previous year, and the total investment ranks second in the world.my country's R&D investment intensity reached 2.68%, ranking 12th among major countries in the world, exceeding the average level of EU countries of 2.11%, and further approaching the average level of 2.73% of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries.The ""Global Innovation Index Report 2024"" recently released by the World Intellectual Property Organization shows that China's global innovation ranking rose one place to 11th from last year, making it one of the economies with the fastest rising innovation in the past 10 years."
"When many Western media, including Reuters and Bloomberg, paid attention to this exclusive interview, they placed it in the context of Sino-US competition and the ongoing Sino-US economic and trade consultations.This observation is not surprising, but it somewhat narrows China’s development logic.Judging from the recent development achievements of Chinese companies, from DeepSeek to Xiaomi Xuanjie chips, Huawei's ""pure blood"" Hongmeng computers, etc., whether they are breakthroughs in key technologies or cluster innovations in multiple fields, in the final analysis, they all reflect the joint effect of national strategies and market laws, making society more efficient, industries more dynamic, and people's lives more convenient.This is determined by China's national conditions and system.Ren Zhengfei’s statement that “one of the purposes of socialism is to develop society” is based on this simple logic.This is also where China has the determination and confidence to deal with various risks and challenges."
"""The development of the private economy in the new era and new journey has broad prospects and great potential. It is time for the majority of private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to show their talents."" General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the private enterprise symposium placed high hopes on private enterprises.As a representative of private entrepreneurs, behind Ren Zhengfei's ""Don't think about the difficulties, just do it"" attitude that hit the screen is the collective praise of countless Chinese people for the spirit of ""Love and hard work will win"", and their firm confidence in winning the future through hard work.Today's China not only needs to ""work"", but also needs to work with determination, endurance and direction.When the world is full of uncertainties, this long-termism and fighting spirit based on hard work are the confidence for China to weather the storm and move toward rejuvenation."
