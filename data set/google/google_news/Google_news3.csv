Editorial: It is the consensus of the international community that force cannot bring peace in the Middle East
"On the 16th, the conflict between Israel and Iran entered its fourth day. The two sides continued to escalate the intensity of the confrontation in a ""tit for tat"" cycle.The mutual attacks between the two sides not only caused casualties and damage to facilities, but also set a dangerous precedent by targeting nuclear facilities and energy facilities. They also aroused deep concern in the international community that the situation is out of control."
"Israel and Iran are both important countries in the Middle East, and Israel-Iran relations affect the war in the Middle East and the overall situation.The top priority is to take immediate measures to avoid the escalation of conflicts, prevent the region from falling into greater turmoil, and return to the track of diplomatic resolution of problems.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has had phone calls with the foreign ministers of Iran and Israel respectively, calling on Iran and Israel to resolve their differences through dialogue. All parties concerned should take immediate measures to put the brakes on the escalation of the conflict and cool down the tension.Russia, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and other countries have also expressed their willingness to mediate.United Nations Secretary-General Guterres wrote on social media: ""Israel bombed Iran's nuclear facilities and Iran's missiles attacked Tel Aviv. Enough has been the escalation. It is time to stop. Peace and diplomacy must prevail."""
"It is crucial to fully realize that only by adhering to the concept of common security can we fully resolve the legitimate concerns of all parties.Why is it not feasible to exert maximum pressure and strike preemptively?The tortuous course of the Iranian nuclear issue itself proves this point.On the surface, the conflict is caused by ""nuclear power"", but in essence it is another manifestation of the security dilemma.Israel is worried that Iran's development of nuclear weapons will threaten its security and adopts a ""preemptive strike"" strategy. However, its violation of Iran's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity has in turn plunged it into greater insecurity.In fact, the moment when the Iranian nuclear issue was closest to a solution was not achieved through ""preemptive strike"". Instead, it was precisely when a binding comprehensive agreement was reached in 2015 after 13 years of ""marathon"" negotiations and with the greatest joint mediation of the international community.If the United States had not ""broke the treaty"" later, and if this agreement had been seriously and fully implemented, both Iran and Israel would obviously be much safer than they are now."
"The ancient Roman scholar Cicero once pointed out: ""The vast majority of people believe that things obtained from war are more valuable than things obtained in a peaceful environment. In fact, this is wrong."" The late former Israeli President Shimon Peres also expressed a similar view: ""Real victory is to harvest peace, rather than sowing the seeds of another war."" The military conflicts that have been staged in the history of the Middle East have not only failed to settle the dispute, but have also laid the lead for the outbreak of more conflicts.The vicious cycle of violence and confrontation continues to deepen the rifts between regional countries, making the path to peaceful resolution of disputes increasingly difficult.If the Middle East region wants to get rid of the predicament of bloodshed and turmoil as soon as possible, it must first abandon the old ""beggar-thy-neighbor"" thinking in the region and advocate a new security concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable.It should be noted that on Middle East security affairs, although countries have different positions and concepts, they still have common interests.Only through dialogue rather than confrontation can it be possible to narrow differences and opposition and find the greatest common denominator for cooperation."
"As a country with special influence on Israel, the United States in particular should shoulder its due responsibilities as a major power in words and deeds.For a long time, people have generally had the impression that it is difficult for the United States to play a constructive role in mitigating regional conflicts, but it is first-class in destructive efforts.The war in the Middle East is difficult to extinguish, and it has something to do with the ""visible hand"" of major powers outside the region.Many analysts believe that the United States' attempt to use ""maximum pressure"" to force Iran to submit is an important reason for the sudden escalation of the situation between Israel and Iran.Singapore's ""Lianhe Zaobao"" said in an editorial that Washington had given Iran 60 days to reach nuclear disarmament negotiations, and Israel launched an attack on the 61st day, ""showing the tacit diplomatic understanding of both sides playing black and white.""An article in the New York Times last year compared the United States to a lion, the ""King of the Jungle in the Middle East,"" and Iran to a ""parasitic wasp,"" advocating that in order to ""kill the parasitic wasp,"" the United States needs to ""burn down the entire jungle.""This kind of thinking is extremely dangerous."
"The security concerns of all countries in the Middle East need to be protected, and force cannot bring peace in the Middle East. This is the general consensus of the international community, including China.At present, diplomatic means for the Iranian nuclear issue have not been exhausted, and there is still hope for a peaceful resolution.The most important thing is that both parties to the conflict and relevant parties take immediate measures to create conditions for returning to the right track of dialogue and negotiation to resolve the issue."
