"Editorial: From Xi'an to Astana, China-Central Asia cooperation moves forward steadily"
"At the invitation of President Tokayev of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Chinese President Xi Jinping went to Astana, Kazakhstan, to attend the Second China-Central Asia Summit from June 16 to 18. He exchanged views with the leaders of the participating Central Asian countries on the development achievements of the China-Central Asia mechanism, mutually beneficial cooperation within the framework, and international and regional hot issues, and made top-level designs for the development of China's relations with the five Central Asian countries.This is the first time that the China-Central Asia Summit is held in a Central Asian country. It ""will usher in a golden era of regional cooperation"" and ""become another milestone in the cooperation between China and Central Asian countries.""The high praise from the media of Central Asian countries fully demonstrates the sincere expectations of regional countries for the summit to promote the construction of a China-Central Asia community with a shared future."
"China's relations with Central Asian countries have profound historical roots, extensive practical needs, and a solid foundation of public opinion.In May 2023, the first China-Central Asia Summit was held in Xi'an. The China-Central Asia mechanism officially set sail, and China's relations with Central Asian countries entered a new stage.At the Xi'an Summit, President Xi Jinping put forward the ""Four Persistences"" on how to build a China-Central Asia community with a shared future and the ""Eight-Point Suggestions"" on how to develop cooperation between China and Central Asian countries, pointing out the direction and path for the development of China-Central Asia relations.From Xi'an to Astana, this cooperation axis stretching for more than 3,000 kilometers not only carries the profound friendship of the Millennium Silk Road, but also injects precious certainty into the turbulent and changing world, becoming a model of unity and cooperation among countries in the global South."
"China and Central Asian countries are fellow travelers on the road to modernization.Since President Xi Jinping proposed the initiative to jointly build the ""Silk Road Economic Belt"" in Kazakhstan in September 2013, Central Asia has become one of the regions with the largest number of projects within the framework of jointly building the ""Belt and Road"" cooperation. The cooperation between the two parties has both ""quantity"" and ""quality"".In the first five months of this year, China's imports and exports to the five Central Asian countries were 286.42 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 10.4%, and the scale reached a record high for the same period in history; the Central Asian Natural Gas Pipeline has transported a total of more than 500 billion cubic meters of natural gas to the country; the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan Gas Pipeline is under constructionThe railway will allow Kyrgyzstan to have a road to the ocean for the first time; the China-Europe trains passing through Central Asia will build bridges of mutual benefit and win-win; from the Confucius Institute and the ""Luban Workshop"", a large number of talents who are familiar with cross-cultural exchanges and master emerging engineering technologies will come out.This ""two-way rush"" between China and Central Asian countries is not only the growth curve on the data report, but also the smiles on the faces of the people on both sides, making the four words ""win-win cooperation"" more tangible."
"“Faced with global challenges such as unilateralism and protectionism, China and Central Asian countries are confidently demonstrating a model of mutual respect, sustainable development, and mutual benefit.” The Central Asian media’s evaluation accurately summarized the core value of cooperation between China and Central Asian countries.Over the past 30 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China and Central Asian countries have always adhered to the principles of mutual respect, good-neighborliness, mutual assistance, mutual benefit and win-win, and have set a model for a new type of international relations.When the ""three-cover"" pattern of the comprehensive strategic partnership, the signing of cooperation documents on the joint construction of the ""Belt and Road"", and the implementation of the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind at the bilateral level take shape, when the global development initiative, the global security initiative, and the global civilization initiative take root and bear fruit here, the vitality bred by the good-neighborly, secure, and prosperous cooperation between China and Central Asian countries will promote this region to become a hope for mutual benefit, win-win, harmony and symbiosis."
"China and Central Asian countries are both countries in the Global South and insist on practicing true multilateralism.China cooperates closely with Central Asian countries within multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia.The two sides jointly defend multilateralism, firmly support each other on issues involving each other's core interests, stand up and speak out for each other at critical moments, safeguard each other's legitimate rights and interests and strategic interests, promote the democratization of international relations, and promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction."
"There is a proverb in Kazakhstan: ""Where there is unity, there will be happiness."" When the leaders of the six countries shake hands in Astana again, the second China-Central Asia Summit will surely become a grand event to further build consensus, deepen cooperation, and promote the construction of a closer China-Central Asia community with a shared future.As good neighbors, good partners, good friends, and good brothers, China and Central Asian countries will use greater wisdom and responsibility to push China-Central Asia relations to a new level and make new and greater contributions to regional and even world peace, stability, and prosperity."
