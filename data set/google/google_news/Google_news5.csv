Editorial: Washington should not be surprised by China’s “tit-for-tat”
"What exactly happened between China and the United States?Why did the economic and trade frictions that had already cooled down ""reignited the flames of war""? How far will the two sides go in the ""tit-for-tat"" confrontation?This is a topic of great concern to international public opinion in recent days.Since the China-U.S. Madrid economic and trade talks, the United States has continued to introduce a series of new restrictive measures against China, trying to blackmail China by escalating tariff threats and various control actions.After encountering resolute countermeasures from China, the United States hurriedly ""put out the fire.""This rollercoaster-like change has once again exposed the arbitrariness and short-sightedness of its trade policy, indicating that Washington still has not fully learned its lessons and failed to truly understand the correct way for China and the United States to get along."
"The sudden change in the economic and trade atmosphere between the two sides was beyond the expectations of many people, but it is not surprising.The direct trigger for this round of escalating economic and trade tensions is the U.S.'s lack of credibility and reneging on its word.This is a long-standing problem in Washington.The South China Morning Post said in an editorial that the latest escalation of tensions between China and the United States can be compared with the tariff war launched by the United States in April this year. ""This is a new round of tit-for-tat measures triggered by new U.S. technology restrictions.""The article warns that tariffs may not be as high as before, but the real damage is that Beijing will view Washington as no longer reliable and have a harder time trusting its commitments.CNN also used the term ""deja vu"" to describe this new round of friction between China and the United States, saying that it is reminiscent of the scene in which the United States dropped a series of ""bombshells"" after the two countries reached a consensus through the Geneva talks in June, leading to a decline in bilateral relations."
"Washington has released many seemingly contradictory signals during this period. On the one hand, it declared that if China does not surrender, it will ""suffer the biggest blow""; on the other hand, it said that it ""hopes to cooperate with China"" and ""much depends on what the Chinese do.""It seems that the ""cooperation"" that some American politicians hope to achieve is: Washington eats and takes from the table for free, while China has to pay for it out of its own pocket or even ""cut off the meat"", allowing the United States to take whatever it wants and clean up the mess it leaves behind.Today, some American politicians are shocked, surprised and even angry at China's reasonable and lawful counterattacks. To some extent, this is because such illusions have been shattered by the reality that ""China is treating the United States more and more equally."""
"The United States overestimated the effectiveness of its own bargaining chips, and at the same time underestimated China's counterattack capabilities and strategic determination. Its misunderstanding directly led to severe reality backlash.After the United States once again threatened to significantly increase tariffs on China, the U.S. stock market and foreign exchange markets fell, triggering panic in global markets and casting a shadow over the world economy.Its willful practices in shipping, export control and other fields have not only seriously damaged China's legitimate rights and interests, but also seriously impacted the international economic, trade and shipping order, and seriously undermined the security and stability of the global production and supply chain.China's ""tit-for-tat"" is not only to defend its own legitimate rights and interests, but also to defend international fairness and justice."
"Many people have noticed that since this year, every round of blackmail launched by the United States against China has been met with failure. Unilateral bullying will inevitably lead to firm and precise countermeasures by China.This kind of ""you come and go"" has formed a clear logic: whoever initiates unreasonable suppression must bear the corresponding consequences.As the ""South China Morning Post"" said, the capriciousness and usual tactics of the United States will not work on China. Beijing's position remains the same - any negotiation must be based on equality, respect and mutual trust.We certainly hope that Washington can take the initiative to correct its wrong practices in a timely manner, but if it continues to exert maximum pressure on China, make false claims, and go back on its words, it is destined to face the pain of being kicked out of the iron plate again and again.In this regard, Washington should develop highly clear behavioral expectations."
"Over the past five months, the Sino-US economic and trade teams have held four talks and reached important consensus, which has stabilized bilateral economic and trade relations and brought stable expectations to the global market.This process fully proves that China and the United States can find solutions to problems on the basis of mutual respect and equal consultation.Looking back on the experience and lessons learned over the past few months, Washington should realize the following points: First, the United States must respect China's legitimate development interests, which naturally include industrial upgrading and technological development; second, China's progress does not mean that the interests of the United States will inevitably be damaged. Although the two countries compete in some areas, they have common interests.The cake is far bigger; third, China and the United States can definitely negotiate on issues of mutual concern, but the result must be win-win. There cannot be a realistic solution of ""the United States wins all and China loses all""; fourth, China does not accept pressure and blackmail. The big stick in Washington's hand is just a paper tiger to the Chinese."
"China has repeatedly emphasized that there are no winners in tariff wars and trade wars, and that equality, respect and reciprocity are the only ways to properly resolve differences.China is unwilling to fight, but it will never sit back and watch its own rights and interests being harmed or international economic and trade rules and the multilateral trading system being undermined.The sooner Washington returns to the correct way of dealing with China, the more likely it is that China-US economic and trade relations will recover."
