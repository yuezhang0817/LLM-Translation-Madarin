"Editorial: The world has never been so eager to understand ""Why China"""
"On October 14, the Second World Congress of Chinese Studies opened in Shanghai.With the theme of ""Historical China and Contemporary China from a World Perspective"", this conference brought together about 500 guests from more than 50 countries and regions to discuss China's history, reality and future.Today, as the process of economic globalization encounters countercurrents and civilized dialogue faces challenges, the international community is paying increasing attention to China, and China's international influence, charisma, and shaping power are also increasing. The world has never been so eager to understand China."
"In 2023, President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the World Congress of China Studies·Shanghai Forum, pointing out that ""China Studies is the study of historical China and also the study of contemporary China.""This discussion clarifies the profound significance of Sinology and provides important guidance for promoting exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations and promoting the prosperity and development of Sinology around the world.This conference has a main forum and five parallel sub-forums. The topics cover multiple key dimensions of China studies, connect historical China and contemporary China from an academic level, embody a holistic vision of civilization, and also convey to the world China's consciousness and efforts to construct a subjective knowledge system in the new era."
"The rise of Chinese studies on a global scale reflects the profound changes in the world's needs and ways of understanding China.Traditional Sinology research mainly focuses on historical China, with documents and ancient civilizations as the main research objects.Sinology, on the other hand, has expanded the scope of research from ""historical China"" to ""contemporary China"", from ""documentary China"" to ""practical China"", and from ""other's China"" to ""subject's China"".Behind this change are historic changes in China's relationship with the world.Today, China is not only an object of academic research, but also a path and method to modernization.Today, as the global landscape undergoes profound adjustments, China has become “a country with huge attraction like a magnet.”The rise of Sinology is an important sign that the world is rediscovering China, understanding China, and learning from China.This kind of discovery and understanding is no longer limited to the ""Orientalist"" gaze of the other, but is based on equal dialogue and mutual learning among civilizations."
"Historically, any major world power needs to establish its own ontology to guide its understanding of the external world.Looking back at world history, Western Europe, Russia, and the United States have all established their own knowledge systems and constructed their own subjectivities in the process of their rise in modern times.For example, American studies began to develop during World War II and matured in the 1960s, which was marked by the emergence of modernization theory.With modernization theory as a symbol, the United States has a theoretical framework for self-understanding and expression, and has constructed its own knowledge system based on this."
"The civilized subjectivity of China studies lies in the fact that China’s development experience cannot be simply summarized using the existing Western theoretical framework.To truly understand China, we must deeply grasp the unique genes of Chinese civilization.Historian Toynbee once lamented that among the more than 20 civilizational forms that have appeared in human history in the past 6,000 years, only Chinese culture has continued to this day and has never been interrupted.General Secretary Xi Jinping profoundly expounded and summarized the five outstanding characteristics of Chinese civilization—continuity, innovation, unity, inclusiveness, and peace. These interrelated characteristics are not only the key to understanding China, but also the foundation for China to build self-confidence.The practice of the Chinese-style modernization path shows that modernization is not equal to Westernization, and the diversity of civilizations is the basic form of human development.Only by getting rid of the shackles of a single narrative can we truly understand China's constructive significance to the world from multiple perspectives."
"As a comprehensive discipline that transcends traditional Sinology and regional China studies, the core value of World China Studies is to reconstruct the global cognitive system of China.This kind of disciplinary expansion has clear practical significance: in the knowledge production system dominated by Western centralism, biased cognition has led to serious misunderstandings - the introduction of the US ""Chinese Exclusion Act"" in the 19th century was directly related to the distorted dissemination of Chinese knowledge.Today, World China Studies provides the international community with an objective framework for understanding China through interdisciplinary methods and a global perspective, and is gradually eliminating the cognitive bias caused by the old ""hegemony-knowledge"" structure."
"As a practice of dialogue among civilizations, the World Congress of Chinese Studies itself is a vivid embodiment of exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations.The continued holding of the conference demonstrates China's determination to integrate into the world with a more open and confident attitude and participate in the construction of the global knowledge system.At a critical crossroads in human development, the spirit of open and inclusive dialogue contained in the conference is particularly valuable.Chinese-style modernization has created a new form of human civilization and is expanding the vast space for the development and progress of human civilization with a new form of civilization."
