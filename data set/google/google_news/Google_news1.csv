"Editorial: Global favorability increases, what has China done right?"
"The U.S. current affairs news website Axios cited a poll conducted by the U.S. Morning Consult Company covering 41 countries and reported that China's global favorability has been on a steady upward curve for more than a year, especially after March this year, showing an accelerated upward trend.As of the end of May, China's global net favorability rating was 8.8, while that of the United States was -1.5.This is the first time that China's global favorability has surpassed that of the United States since the agency began tracking it.This is not an isolated case. In recent years, many international surveys have pointed to the same trend - the world's view of China is becoming increasingly friendly and positive."
"The improvement in global favorability lies in the fact that China has always been a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order. These efforts and achievements have had a positive impact on the international community.China's development and progress have not only benefited its own people, but also made important contributions to world peace and development.China's contribution to world economic growth remains at around 30%, and its economic growth rate ranks among the highest in the world among major economies.After more than ten years of jointly building the Belt and Road Initiative, it has become a visible and tangible change in the lives of countless ordinary people.In Africa, thousands of hydropower stations built by Chinese companies have been lit up; in Southeast Asia, industrial parks supported by Chinese technology and investment have sprung up.These projects do not attach political conditions or engage in ""teacher"" preaching. They only sincerely respond to the urgent desire of partner countries to develop their economies and improve people's livelihood.What the world feels is China's tolerance and goodwill that ""development together is true development."""
"From mediating the reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, to actively implementing the Paris Agreement, from promoting the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), to promoting the expansion of the BRICS cooperation mechanism, China has shown the world the image of a responsible major country.Behind this, there is the guidance of advanced concepts and the support of pragmatic actions.Since the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative were proposed, they have received positive response and support from more than 100 countries and international and regional organizations, injecting valuable stability and positive energy into a world intertwined with chaos.By actively contributing to global development assistance projects, promoting political solutions to hot-spot issues, and injecting new impetus into strengthening dialogue among civilizations, China has accurately grasped the development trend of the times, focused on the common well-being of all mankind, reflected the common aspirations of people of all countries for peace and development, and won increasingly wider global recognition."
"The rise in China's favorability also reflects the world's recognition and respect for a country that is confident and independent, upholds justice, supports the weak and promotes good.In the face of rising unilateralism and protectionism, China firmly stands on the right side of history and promotes the construction of an open world economy.In the face of hegemonism and power politics, China has always adhered to justice, upheld justice, firmly safeguarded the international order based on international law, and promoted the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.At the same time, a country's good image is also reflected in the continuous improvement of its soft power.Today, China's cultural creativity is embracing the world with unprecedented vitality.From ""Genshin Impact"" and ""Black Myth: Wukong"" to TikTok and ""Little Red Book"", from mini-series hit overseas and DeepSeek whirlwind to ""China Travel"" and ""Hyperthyroid Brother"", the ""cocoon-breaking"" effect of these phenomena and products has broken the information cocoon woven by Western media for a long time, allowing the world to see a real China with a strong sense of technology, a profound historical background, and a warm and cheerful people."
"The world's goodwill also comes from China's open and inclusive mind and confidence in the future.China knows very well that opening up brings progress, while closing down will inevitably lead to backwardness.We continue to expand the visa-free ""circle of friends"", continue to shorten the negative list for foreign investment access, optimize the business environment, and allow global companies to share the dividends brought by China's development.The latest survey released by HSBC shows that among more than 5,700 multinational companies covering 13 markets around the world, the proportion of choosing China as the target market is the highest in the world.China's innovative breakthroughs in the fields of high-end manufacturing, green energy and artificial intelligence not only drive its own high-quality development, but also contribute ""Chinese solutions"" to solve common challenges of mankind with leading technology and high-quality services."
"China’s rise in global favorability is no accident.It is the natural result of China's decades of hard work and peaceful development; it is the inevitable echo of adhering to consultation, joint contribution and sharing, and practicing true multilateralism; it is the picture of the times that thousands of Chinese enterprises, cultural workers, and ordinary people have jointly painted with sincere cooperation, innovative products, and friendly smiles.This good impression is a recognition of China's path and an affirmation of China's contribution. It is also a vivid footnote that the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and has taken root.It reminds us that the image of a great power is not shaped by aggressive words but by silent practice; it is not by deliberately creating a ""persona"" but by persevering in ""doing the right thing"".By firmly moving forward along this road of win-win cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, a credible, lovable, and respectable image of China will surely become clearer and warmer in the hearts of people around the world."
