"In order to establish a monument for my family, I once ran back to Gaomi Northeast Township and conducted a large number of investigations. The focus of the investigation was this famous battle my father participated in to kill the major general of the Japanese by the Moshui River.A 92-year-old old lady in our village said to me: ""Northeast Township is full of people, and the formation is arranged by the Mohe River. Commander Yu, standing in front of the formation, with the sound of cannons scattered in one tide. The souls of the Eastern Japanese devils scattered and fell on the plains. The leader of the female leader Dai Fenglian, with beautiful appearance and clever mechanisms, and he transferred an iron rake to scatter the series to block the Japanese from the front..."" The old woman's head was as bald as a pottery jar, her face was rotten, and her dry hands were covered with tendons like loofahs.She was a survivor of the massacre on the Mid-Autumn Festival in August 1939. At that time, she couldn't run because of a sore on her feet. She was stuffed into a sweet potato cellar and hid it. She survived by chance.Dai Fenglian, the old woman sang a quick song, is my grandma's big sigil.I was extremely excited to hear this.This shows that the plan to use an iron rake to block the Japanese car's retreat was actually my grandmother, the female litter.My grandma should also be the pioneer of the anti-Japanese war and the hero of the nation."
"When my grandma mentioned, the old lady talked too much.Her words were broken and messy, like a group of leaves rolling all over the ground with the wind.When she talked about my grandma's feet, they were the smallest feet in the village.Our family’s soybean wine has a lot of energy.When talking about Jiaoping Highway, her words were coherent: ""When the road was built to our territory... the sorghum was waist deep... the Japanese drove all the people who could work... the Russians were lazy and tiring... the two big black mules in your house were also pulled away... the Japanese were scattered on the stone bridge in the Moshui River... the Arhat, the old worker of your family... he and your grandma were not innocent, and they all said so... Hey, your grandma was having too many flowers when she was young... your father was so capable, he killed people at the age of fifteen, and a hero from a bastard, nine out of ten were not good... the Arhat went to shovel mule legs... and was caught and cut with a knife... the Japanese were hurting people, shitting in the pot and peeing in the basin. That year, when I went to carry water, I picked up something, a head, and a big braid..."""
"Uncle Liu Luohan is an important figure in our family’s history.It is impossible to find out whether there is an affair between him and my grandma.Admittedly, from the bottom of my heart, I don't want to admit that this is the truth."
"Although I understand the truth, the old lady who canned pots still embarrassed me.I think, since Mr. Luohan treats my father like his grandson, he is like my great-grandfather; if this great-grandfather had ever had a romantic relationship with my grandmother, wouldn't it be incest?This is actually a dream.Because my grandmother is not the daughter-in-law of Mr. Luohan but his boss. Mr. Luohan only has economic connections with my family but no blood relationship. He is like a loyal family member who embellishes the history of my family and undoubtedly adds glory to the history of our family.Whether my grandma has loved him or whether he has been on my grandma’s kang has nothing to do with ethics.So what if I have loved it?I firmly believe that my grandma dares to do anything, as long as she is willing.She is not only a hero in the anti-Japanese war, but also a pioneer in the liberation of personality and a model of women's independence."
"I have checked the county annals, which states that in the 27th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese army captured a total of 400,000 civilians from Gaomi, Pingdu and Jiaoxian, and built the Jiaoping Highway.Destroy countless crops.Mules and horses in the villages on both sides of the road were looted.Farmer Liu Luohan sneaked in at night and used a shovel to hurt countless mules, hooves, horses and legs, and was caught.The next day, the Japanese army peeled Liu Luohan on the horse-tie stake and showed him the public.Liu was not afraid of his face and scolded him endlessly, and he would not stop until his death."
