Red_sorghum_Chapter4_Google
"The team walked up the river bank, lined up in a row, and the red sun that had just struggled out of the fog shone on them.My father, like everyone else, was half blushing and half green, and watched the fog on the setting sun on the Moshui River with them.What connects the highways in Henan and Hebei is the fourteen-hole stone bridge across the Moshui River.The original small wooden bridge is on the west side of the stone bridge. The bridge deck has been broken for three or five long ago. Several brown piles stand in the river, helplessly blocking clusters of blue and white waves.The river surface in the fog is red, green and green, serious and terrifying.Standing on the river bank, I looked up and saw the vast sorghum on the south side of the bank, which was as flat as the sorghum.They are not moving at all.Each ear of sorghum is a deep red mature face.Therefore, some sorghum synthesizes a strong collective to form a generous idea.——My father was still young at that time and could not have imagined these sweet words, which I thought."
Sorghum waits with people for the flowers of time to bear fruit.
"The road went straight south, the further it became narrower, and finally it was flooded by sorghum.The farthest place, on the sorghum connected to the edge of the iron-green dome, also presents a moving and tragic scene at sunrise."
"My father looked at the demented guerrillas with curiosity. Where did they come from?Where are they going?Why ambush?What else can I hit after the ambush?In the quietness, the rhythm of the water aroused by the broken bridge is more distinct and the sound is crisp and clear.The fog was knocked down into the river by the sun.The river of Moshui gradually ignites from dark red to golden red.The river is filled with brilliance.There is a lonely water vein by the water, with yellow leaves hanging low, and the once glorious silkworm-like inflorescences hanging pale among the leaves.It's the season to catch crabs again!My father thought, the autumn wind was blowing, the weather was cold, and a group of geese flew south... Uncle Luohan said, catch, bean official... catch!The crab's delicate claws imprinted the fine and soft river mud with patterns.My father smelled the elegant fishy smell unique to crabs from the river.The poppy flowers planted before the Anti-Japanese War were fed with crab sauce. The flowers were plump, colorful and fragrant."
"Commander Yu said, ""Everyone is hidden from the dike. I will put the rake on the silence."""
"The mute took off a few circles of wire from his shoulders and tied the four plates together.He shouted twice, greeted several team members, and carried the chain rakes to the junction of the highway and the stone bridge."
"Commander Yu said, ""Brothers, hide it, wait until the Japanese car is on the bridge, wait until the people of the Leng Detachment block the retreat, listen to my slogan and open fire, and knock the beasts into the river to feed the white eels and crabs."""
"Commander Yu made a few gestures to the mute. The mute nodded, and with half of the guns, he stumbled into the sorghum field west of the road.Wang Wenyi followed the mute westward and was pushed back by the mute.Commander Yu said, ""Don't go over, follow me. Are you afraid?"""
"Wang Wenyi nodded repeatedly and said, ""Don't be afraid...I'm not afraid..."""
"Commander Yu asked the Fang brothers to put the big lift pole on the river bank.He also said to Liu Chushou, who was holding a big horn, ""Old Liu, please keep the fire in your mouth, don't worry about anything, but you are slamming the trumpet for me. The Japanese are afraid of the sound of the instrument. Have you heard it?"""
"Liu Chushou was Commander Yu's early companion. At that time, the commander was the sedan chairman and Liu was the drummer. He held the trumpet in both hands, as if holding a gun."
"Commander Yu said to everyone: ""When the ugly words come to the forefront, I will break him if anyone wants a rooster. We want to show off to Leng Detachment. Those bastards are scaring people with their banners. I don't eat him. He wants to adapt me? I still want to adapt him!"""
"Everyone sat around the sorghum field. Fang Liu took out his cigarette pouch to put it in cigarettes and took out a scythe and flint to ignite it.The fire sickle is black, the flint is red, just like the cooked chicken liver.The fire scythe hit the flint.Mars flew, and every Mars was huge.A large spark splashed onto the core of the sorghum stalk that Fang Liu pinched with his index finger and ring finger. Fang Liu sucked the breath, and a wisp of white smoke came out of the turtle, which turned red.Fang Liu lit the pipe and took a sip of the cigarette.Commander Yu breathed, sniffed, and said, ""I knocked the cigarette, will the Japanese go up to the bridge when they smelled the smoke?"""
"Fang Liu took a few tight puffs, knocked his cigarette pipe, and packed it.Commander Yu said: ""Everyone lie down on the slope of the river embankment, so as not to catch the Japanese off guard."""
"Everyone was a little nervous, lying on the river bank, holding a gun in his hand, as if facing a great enemy.My father lay beside Commander Yu.Commander Yu asked, ""Are you afraid?"" His father said, ""Not afraid!"""
"Commander Yu said, ""Good thing is your godfather's seed! You are my messenger. Don't leave me when you fight. If you have any orders, I'll tell you, and you'll pass it to me to the west."""
"Father nodded.He stared at the two guns in Commander Yu's waist with greed.One is big, the other is small."
"The big one is made by the Lai Box gun in Germany, and the small one is the French Browning pistol.These two guns have their own origins."
"A word burst out from my father's mouth: ""Gun!"""
"Commander Yu said, ""Do you want a gun?"""
"The father nodded and said, ""Gun."""
"Commander Yu said, ""Can you do it?"""
"""Yes!"" said my father."
"Commander Yu pulled out Browning's pistol from his waist and weighed it in his hand.The pistol is old, and the burning blue is gone.Commander Yu pulled the bolt and a round-headed bullet with a brass shell jumped out of the bullet casing.He threw the bullet a high, reached out to catch it, and pressed it into the gun."
"""Give it to you!"" said Commander Yu, ""use it just like I do."""
"My father caught the gun.My father held the gun and remembered that the night before yesterday, Commander Yu used the gun to break a wine cup."
"At that time, the moon rose at the beginning of the eyebrows, pressing down on the dead branches.My father held a jar of wine and held a copper key, and followed grandma's orders to go to the soju shop to serve wine.My father opened the door, and the courtyard was quiet, the mule shed was dark, and the workshop was filled with the turbid air of rotten wine lees.My father uncovered a lid of an urn and took advantage of the stars and moonlight to see his thin face on the clear wine face.His father had short eyebrows and thin lips, and he felt that he was ugly.He pressed the jar into the jar and poured the wine into the jar.When the jar is lifted out of the jar, the wine on the jar falls into the jar.My father changed his mind and poured the wine from the jar into the jar.My father remembered the jar of wine that grandma had washed her bloody face.Grandma was drinking with Commander Yu and Captain Leng at home. Grandma and Commander Yu were both full of them, but Captain Leng was a little drunk.My father walked to the urn and saw a stone mill pressing on the wooden urn.He put down the wine jar and lifted the stone mill with all his strength.The stone mill rolled twice on the ground, hit another wine jar, and knocked a big hole in the wall of the jar, and the sorghum wine rushed out, and my father ignored it.My father opened the lid of the jar and smelled the bloody smell of Mr. Luohan.He remembered the bloody head of the Luohan and the bloody face of his mother.The face of the Luohan and the mother's face emerged one after another in the jar.My father pressed the jar into the jar, filled it with bloody wine, held it in both hands, and returned home."
"On the Eight Immortals table, Mingzhu was having a high fever, Commander Yu and Captain Leng were all panting.Grandma stood among the two of them, and grandma pressed Captain Leng's revolver with her left hand and Commander Yu's Browning's pistol with her right hand."
"My father heard my grandmother say, ""Is it true that business is not successful? This is not a place to use swords and guns. If you have the ability to go to the Japanese."""
"Commander Yu cursed angrily: ""Brother-in-law, you can't scare me even if you take the banner of Brigade Commander Wang. I am the king on this territory. I have been eating cakes for ten years and still care about the donkey-sun who is the king's claw!"""
"Captain Leng smiled coldly and said, ""Brother Zhanzhao, brothers are for your own good, and Brigade Commander Wang is for your own good. As long as you pull the pole over, you will be a battalion commander. The gun pay will be given to Brigade Commander Wang, and it is as if you are a bandit."""
"""Who is a bandit? Who is not a bandit? If you can fight Japan, it is a great hero in China. Last year, I touched three Japanese posts and got three large cover guns. Your Leng Detachment is not a bandit, how many Japanese devils have you killed? The Japanese Mao didn't pull down one."""
Captain Leng sat down and took out a cigarette to light it.
"Taking advantage of the opportunity, my father went up with the wine jar.Grandma took the wine jar, her face changed suddenly, and she glanced at her father fiercely.Grandma poured wine into three bowls, each bowl was poured out to the top."
"Grandma said, ""There is blood from Uncle Arhat in this wine, so if it is a man, I will drink it. I will beat the Japanese car together the next day, and then you will go through the chicken path, and the dog path will go through the dog path, and the well water will not interfere with the river."""
Grandma picked up the wine and drank it.
Commander Yu picked up the wine and poured it on his neck.
"Captain Leng picked up the wine and drank half a bowl.Putting down the bowl, he said, ""Commander Yu, brothers are so drunk, I'm farewell!"""
"Grandma pressed the revolver and asked, ""Can you fight?"""
"Commander Yu said angrily: ""Don't ask him, he won't beat him, I will beat you!"""
"Captain Leng said, ""Fight."""
"Grandma let go of her hand, Captain Leng grabbed the revolver and hung it on her belt."
"Captain Leng has a white face and a dozen black pockmarks around his nose.There was a large circle of bullets on his belt. After hanging the gun, the belt hung into a ditch."
"Grandma said, ""Zhanzhao, I will hand over the bean official to you, and you can take him there the next day."""
"Commander Yu looked at my father and asked with a smile: ""Godson, do you have any kindness?"""
"The father looked at the earth-yellow and solid teeth that appeared between Commander Yu's lips with contempt, without saying a word."
"Commander Yu took a wine cup and placed it on my father's head, asking my father to retreat to the door and stand still.He picked up Browning's pistol and walked towards the corner."
"My father watched Commander Yu take three steps in front of the corner, each step was so big and slow, and grandma's face was pale.Captain Leng had two mocking smile patterns on the corner of his mouth."
"Commander Yu walked to the corner and stood firm, turning around suddenly. His father saw his arms raised flat and his eyes were so dark that it was red.Browning spits out a wisp of white smoke at the mouth of his gun.There was a loud bang on my father's head, and the wine cup was fried to pieces.A small piece of porcelain fell on my father's neck. When my father shrugged his head, the piece of porcelain slid into his waist.My father said nothing.Grandma's face turned paler.Captain Leng sat on the bench and said after a while: ""Good shooting skills."""
"Commander Yu said, ""Good boy!"""
My father held the Browning pistol and felt it was surprisingly heavy.
"Commander Yu said, ""I don't need to teach you, you know how to fight. Pass my order to the mute and let them be prepared!"""
"My father, carrying a pistol, got into the sorghum field, crossed the road, and walked to the mute.The mute sat cross-legged and grinded a slender waist knife with a piece of green stone.Other team members were sitting and lying."
"The father said to the mute, ""Let you be ready."""
"The mute glanced at his father and continued to sharpen the knife.After grinding for a while, he tore up a few sorghum leaves, wiped off the stone foam from the knife edge, pulled out another fine grass, and tried the blade.The grass broke quietly as soon as it touched the blade."
"The father said again, ""Let you be ready!"""
The mute put the waist knife into the sheath and placed it beside him.A hideous smile appeared on his face.He raised a big hand and waved at his father.
"""Um! Um!"" said the mute."
"My father tiptoed forward and stopped one step away from the mute.The mute leaned over, pulled his father's clothes, and tried hard to put his father in his arms.The mute twisted his father's ears and his father's mouth grinned on his cheeks.My father poked the mute's backbone with a Browning pistol.The mute pressed his father's nose again and pressed it hard, and tears came out of his father's eyes.The mute smiled strangely."
The team members sitting around the mute laughed in unison.
"""Do you look like Commander Yu?"""
"""It's the seed under Commander Yu."""
"""Official Dou, I miss your mother."""
"""Douguan, I want to eat your mother's two jujube buns."""
"My father was so angry that he raised his pistol, aimed it at the one who wanted to eat the jujube cake and hugged the fire.Browning's pistol banged, and the bullet did not come out."
"The man's face turned gray and yellow, he jumped up quickly to seize his father's pistol.My father was furious and rushed onto the man, kicking and biting him."
"The mute stood up and pulled his father's neck and threw it hard. His father's body floated off the ground, breaking several sorghum trees when they fell.My father beat him up and got up, cursed, and threw himself in front of the mute, and the mute whispered twice.My father looked at his dark face and was buried there.The mute took the Browning pistol and pulled the bolt, and a bullet fell into his hand.He pinched the bullet, looked at the small hole in the bullet's butt door that was hit by the striker, and gestured at his father a few times.The mute inserted the gun into his father's waist and patted his father's head."
"""What are you making trouble over there?"" asked Commander Yu."
"The father said aggrievedly: ""They... want to get sleepy with my mother."""
"Commander Yu asked with a stern face, ""What did you say?"""
"The father raised his arm and wiped his eyes, saying, ""I shot him!"""
"""You shot?"""
"""The gun didn't sound."" My father handed the golden stinky fire to Commander Yu."
Commander Yu took the bullet and looked at it. He easily fell out. The bullet slipped in a beautiful arc and fell into the river.
"Commander Yu said, ""Good! Gunzier first hits the Japanese. After hitting the Japanese, whoever dares to say he wants to sleep with your mother, shoot him in the belly. Don't hit him in the head, don't hit him in the chest. Remember, hit him in the belly."""
"My father was lying beside Commander Yu.On his right are the Fang brothers.The large lift pole is mounted on the river bank, with the muzzle facing the stone bridge.A ball of broken cotton wool was blocked at the muzzle.A fuze is raised from the rear of the lifting rod.Next to Fang Qi, there was a handful of turtle made of sorghum stem core, and one of them was burning.Fang Liu had a medicine gourd and an iron box containing iron beans next to him."
On the left side of Commander Yu is Wang Wenyi.He held the long-dollar bird gun in both hands and his body shook.His wounded ears were already condensed with the white cloth.
"The sun was getting taller, and the snow-white core was also surrounded by a light red circle.The river water is shiny, and a group of wild ducks fly over the sorghum.Round three circles, most of them pounced on the grass on the river beach, and a small part fell into the river, drifting with the river.The wild duck in the river kept its body still, and only turned its flexible head and neck around.My father was warm.The clothes wet with dew were completely dry.After lying for a while, my father felt a stone hurting his chest, so he got up and sat up, his head and chest were raised above the surface of the dam.Commander Yu said, ""Let's go down."" His father lay down reluctantly again.The Fang family Lao Liu snored from his nose.Commander Yu picked up a piece of muddy and threw it on Fang Liu's face.Fang Liu sat up in a daze, yawned, and squeezed out two small tears."
"""Are the Japanese coming?"" Fang Liu said loudly."
"""Fuck your mother!"" Commander Yu said, ""Don't be sleepy."""
"Henan and Hebei are silent, and the wide road lies in the bushes of sorghum in silence.The big stone bridge on the river is so beautiful.The boundless sorghum faces the taller and brighter sun, with brighter faces bright red and shy.The wild duck was searching for something with its flat mouth by the shallow water, making a croaking sound.The father's eyes stopped on the wild ducks, studying their beautiful feathers and clever eyes.He held a heavy Browning pistol and aimed at the duck's flat back.He almost pulled the trigger.Commander Yu held his hand and said, ""Little Turtle, what do you want to do?"""
"My father felt irritable and restless, and the road was still lying dead.The sorghum is even brighter."
"""If he dares to play tricks on me, this beast Leng Mazi!"" Commander Yu said fiercely.Henan is silent and the Leng Detachment does not even see a shadow.My father knew that the information passed by the Japanese car was obtained by Captain Leng. Captain Leng was afraid that the family would not be able to fight, so he came to join Commander Yu's team."
"My father was nervous for a while, but gradually became lazy.His eyes were attracted by the wild ducks again and again.He remembered the incident of following Mr. Luohan to fight ducks.Uncle Luohan has a bird gun, black red holder and cowhide gun belt.This bird gun is being held by Wang Wenyi."
"My father's eyes were covered with tears, but less than the number that flowed out of his eyes.Just like the day last year.In the warm sunshine, my father felt a piercing cold spreading all over his body."
"Uncle Luohan and two mules were captured by the Japanese and puppet troops together, and grandma washed away blood in the wine jar.Grandma's face was full of wine, her skin was red, her eyelids were a little swollen, and her chest was wet with wine and blood stains on her moon-white cloth gown.Grandma stood beside the urn, staring at the wine in the urn, which reflected her face.My father remembered that grandma fell to the ground and kowtowed three times to the wine jar.Then she stood up and scooped up a handful of wine with both hands and drank.Grandma's face was rosy, and she concentrated on her cheeks, but her forehead and chin were pale and colorless."
"""Kneel down!"" Grandma ordered her father: ""Kowtow."""
My father knelt down and kowtowed.
"""Please drink a sip of wine!"""
My father drank it with the wine.
"Bloodlines were sinking vertically under the urn like threads.A small white cloud floated in the jar, and the solemn faces of grandma and father were placed.Grandma's slender eyes shot out of burning light, and my father didn't dare to look at it.My father's heart was beating, and he stretched out his hand and scooped a handful of wine from the jar. The wine fell from his fingers, breaking the big and small face of the blue sky and white clouds.My father took another sip of wine, and a bloody smell stuck to his tongue.The bloodshots sank to the bottom of the urn, and gathered into a fist-sized turbid group in the middle of the raised urn.My father and grandma watched it for a long time.Grandma pulled up the lid of the urn, rolled a millstone from the corner of the wall, lifted it hard, and pressed it on the lid of the urn."
"""Don't touch it!"" said grandma."
My father nodded in panic nod as he looked at the damp soil in the groove of the millstone and the creeping gray-green wet insects.
"That night, my father lay on his little bed and listened to my grandmother walking around the yard.Grandma's clucking footsteps and the sorghum in the fields weaving her father's chaotic dreams.In my dream, my father heard the two beautiful big black mules chirping at my house."
"At the bright day, my father woke up once.He ran to the yard naked to pee, and saw his grandmother still standing in the yard looking at the sky in a daze.The father called out to mother, but grandma didn't answer.After my father urinated, he pulled his grandmother's hand into the room.Grandma turned around and entered the house with her father softly and tiredly.As soon as I entered the house, I heard a wave of noise coming from the southeast, followed by a shot.The gunshots were very sharp, like a sharp blade, breaking the crisp silk."
"The place where my father was lying now was full of white stone strips and stones, and piles of coarse yellow sand were piled on the embankment, like rows of large graves.The sorghum in early summer last year was in a heavy daze outside the dike.The outline of the road that was overwhelmed by the rollers stretched northward.At that time, the big stone bridge had not been built yet, and the small wooden bridge was exhausted and scarred by thousands of steps and trampled by mules and horses.The smell of green seedlings flowing out of the kneaded sorghum is soaked in the night fog, which is even stronger in the early morning.The sorghum in the fields was crying bitterly.Shortly after hearing the gunshot, my father and grandmother were driven here with several elderly, weak and weak women and children in the village.At that time, the sun had just risen to the sorghum peaks. My father, grandma and a group of people stood on the west side of Henannan Road, stepping on the wreckage of sorghum under his feet.The fathers looked at the huge fence like a horse ring in the bullpen, and a large group of ragged men shrank outside the fence.Later, the two puppet troops drove the group of civilians to the west of the road, next to their fathers and the others, forming another group of people.In front of the fathers and the husbands, there was a place where the mules and horses were tied up later.People stood withered and unknown how long it took, and finally saw a Japanese official wearing two red cloth on his shoulders, a steel knife mopping on his hips, a wolf dog, two white gloves, and a clean face coming from the tent.Behind him, the wolfdog hung its bright tongue. Behind the wolfdog, two puppet soldiers were carrying a hard body of Japanese soldiers. The two Japanese soldiers were at the end, escorting the bloody and bloody Arhat master held by the two puppet soldiers.My father leaned hard on my grandmother, and my grandmother hugged her."
"Japanese official led his dog and parked in an open space near the mule and horse farm.More than fifty white birds flew out from the ink river, flew through the blue sky above the crowd, and turned eastward toward the gold-like sun.My father saw the furry and dirty livestock on the mule and horse farm, and saw the two big black mules lying on the ground.A mule died, and the shovel was still standing on its head.The black blood made the broken sorghum on the ground and the mule's smooth face dirty.The other mule was sitting on the ground, with its bloody tail brushing against the ground, and its thick skin trembled soundly.There was a whistle-like sound in the two nostrils that opened and closed.My father didn't know how much he loved these two black mules.Grandma was riding on the mule's back with her chest raised and raised her head. Her father sat in her grandma's arms. The mule carried the mother and son, galloping on the dirt road under the sorghum. The mule ran forward and backward, and her father and grandma were being pushed up and down.The thin mule legs rose up all the way.My father screamed in excitement.The sparse farmers stood by the sorghum field, holding a hoe or other farm tools in their hands, staring at the gorgeous pink face of the female shopkeeper of the sorghum workshop, full of jealousy and hatred.The two big black mules in my house fell to the ground and died, their lips were wide open, and a row of snow-white rectangular teeth were chewing on the ground.Sitting on the other end is even more uncomfortable than death.The father said to grandma, ""Mom, our mule."" Grandma reached out to cover her father's mouth."
"The body of the Japanese soldier was parked in front of the Japanese official standing with a knife and a dog.The two puppet soldiers dragged the bloody and bloody uncle Arhat toward a high stake with a horse tied up.My father did not recognize Mr. Luohan immediately.My father saw a humanoid monster that was smashed.He was held up, and his head suddenly tilted to the left and then to the right. The blood scab on his head was like a layer of smooth mud deposited on a river beach that fell into the water. It was exposed to the sun, wrinkled and cracked.His feet were scratching the ground, and some twists and turns were drawn on the ground.The crowd quietly gathered.The father felt grandma's hand firmly pinching his shoulders.Everyone has become shorter, some have faces like yellow earth, and some have faces like black soil.For a moment, I could hear the breathing of the big wolf dog Hada Hada. The Japanese official who was holding the wolf dog let out a loud fart.My father saw the puppet army dragging the humanoid monster to a tall horse-tie stake. When he let go, the monster collapsed on the ground like a pile of bone-cut flesh."
"The father screamed in surprise: ""Uncle Luohan!"""
Grandma covered her father's mouth again.
"Uncle Luohan moved slowly under the horse stake and first stuck out his butt.He built an arch bridge shape, and then knelt on the ground with both knees, pressed his hands on the ground, and raised his head.His face was swollen and bright, his eyes became two thin slits, and two dark green light shot out from the cracks of his eyes.My father was facing Uncle Luohan, and he believed that Uncle Luohan must have seen him.The organs in his face were thumping and thumping, he couldn't tell whether it was horror or anger. He wanted to howl hard, but his mouth was firmly covered by grandma's palms."
"The Japanese official who was holding a dog shouted at the crowd for a while, and a Chinese man with a small flat head translated the words of the Japanese official to everyone."
"My father didn't listen to everything as the translator said.My grandma covered his mouth, her eyes buzzing and her ears buzzing."
"Two Chinese in black stripped the Arhat to the wooden stake naked.The Japanese official waved his hand, and two men in black escorted Sun Wu, a famous pig-killer in our village, from the wooden fence, to push and shov."
"Sun Wu is short, full of flesh, with a swelling belly, hairless on his head, red face, small eyes, and a deep side of his nose.He held a sharp knife in his left hand and a bucket of clean water in his right hand, and walked to the front of Mr. Luohan tremblingly."
"The translator said: ""Taijun said, let you peel it well. If you can't peel it well, let the wolf dog open your chamber."""
"Sun Wu kept making noises and his eyelids blinked urgently.He held the knife in his mouth, lifted the bucket, and poured it down from the head of the Luohan.Uncle Luohan was stimulated by the cold water, and his head suddenly raised, and blood flowed to his heels along his face and neck in a turbid manner.A supervisor brought another bucket of water from the river. Sun Wu dipped a piece of rag in water and wiped the Arhat uncle clean.Sun Wu wiped the Luohan uncle clean, twisted his butt and said, ""Brother..."""
"Uncle Luohan said, ""Brother, stab me with one knife. I will never forget your kindness in the underworld."""
The Japanese official roared.
"The translator said: ""Hurry up and do it!"""
"Sun Wu's face changed, he stretched out his thick and short fingers, pinched the old man's ears, and said, ""Brother, brother, there's nothing he can do..."""
"My father saw Sun Wu's knife sawing on the old man's ears like sawing wood.Uncle Luohan shouted wildly, and a burnt water of urine jumped out from between his legs.My father's legs trembled.Walking past a Japanese soldier holding a white porcelain plate, standing beside Sun Wu, Sun Wu put the fat ears of the Arhat in the white porcelain plate.Sun Wu cut off the other ear of the Arhat and put it into the porcelain plate.My father saw the two ears of Mr. Luohan beating lively in the porcelain plate, making the porcelain plate ding ding dong dong."
"Japanese soldiers carried porcelain plates and walked slowly past the civilians, men, women, young and old.My father saw that the Luohan's ears were pale and beautiful, and the sound of the porcelain plate became even stronger."
"The Japanese soldier brought his ears to the Japanese official, and the officer nodded.The Japanese soldiers placed the porcelain plate next to the Japanese soldiers' corpse, silent for a moment, then held it up again, and placed it under the wolf dog's mouth."
"The wolfdog put away his tongue and sniffed the two ears with its pointed, black nose.It shook its head, stuck out its tongue, and squatted."
"The translator said to Sun Wu: ""Hey, cut it again!"""
"Sun Wu was spinning around in the same circle, saying something in his mouth. His father saw his face full of oil and sweat, and his eyes blinked as quickly as a chicken pecking at rice."
"Only a few drops of blood flowed from the base of the ears of the Luohan. As soon as the Luohan's ears were gone, his entire head became very simple."
The Japanese officer roared again.
"The translator said: ""Cut it quickly!"""
"Sun Wu bent down, swept down the male organ of the Luohan, and put it into the porcelain plate held by the Japanese soldiers.The Japanese soldier stretched his arms stiffly, looked straight, and walked past the crowd like a puppet.My father felt that grandma's cold fingers almost clenched into his shoulders."
The Japanese soldier put the porcelain plate under the wolf dog's mouth. The wolf dog bit it twice and spit it out again.
"Uncle Luohan shouted shrillly, his skinny body twisting violently on the horse-tie stake."
"Sun Wu threw down the knife, knelt on the ground, and cried loudly."
"The Japanese official loosened his belt, and the wolf dog rushed up, pressed his front paws on Sun Wu's shoulders, and shook his sharp teeth in front of Sun Wu.Sun Wu lay on the ground, covering his face with both hands."
"The Japanese official whistled, and the wolfdog ran back with his leash."
"The translator said: ""Strike it!"""
"Sun Wu got up, pinched the knife, and walked to the Luohan uncle, one high and one low."
"Uncle Luohan cursed, and everyone raised their heads amid the scolding of Uncle Luohan."
"Sun Wu said, ""Brother...Brother...you should bear it..."""
Uncle Luohan spitted a mouthful of bloody phlegm on Sun Wu's face.
"""Strike it, fuck your ancestors, peel it!"""
"Sun Wu was holding a knife and peeled off the wound that was turning out of the head of the Luohan, and a knife rustled.He peeled it very carefully.Uncle Luohan's scalp fell off.The blue eyes were revealed.The flesh that exposed..."
"My father told me that after the Luohan's face was peeled off, his unshakable mouth was still rumbling, and strings of bright red blood beads flowed down from his sour scalp.Sun Wu is no longer like a human being. His swordsmanship is so exquisite that he peels a piece of skin intact.After the uncle Luohan was peeled into a flesh core, the intestines in his stomach were ready to move, and groups of green flies were flying all over the sky.The women in the crowd all knelt on the ground, their crying shocked the wilderness.That night, heavy rain fell from the sky, washing the blood on the mule and horse farm clean, and the body and skin of the Arhat were gone.There is news that the body of the Luohan is missing in the village. One is spreading to ten, ten is spreading to hundreds, one generation after another, and it has become a beautiful story of China."
"""If he dares to play tricks on me, I will twist his head off to make a urinary!"" The sun was getting smaller and smaller, emitting incandescent light, and the dew on the sorghum became thinner, and a group of wild ducks flew away, and another group of them flew away.The people from the Leng Detachment had not arrived yet, and there was no living creature except for the occasional hares on the road.Later, a fiery red fox jumped out sneakily.After scolding Captain Leng, Commander Yu shouted, ""Hey, get up, you probably have been fooled by Leng Mazi."""
"The team members were already tired and wanted to shout.The commander got up as soon as he gave the order. Some sat on the river bank and smoked with fire, while others stood on the river bank and urinated down the bank with force."
"After my father jumped onto the river bank, he was still thinking about some scenes from last year. Uncle Luohan's head was shaking in front of his eyes.The wild ducks were frightened by the sudden emergence of people, flew up together, and then landed on the river beach not far away, walking staggeringly, with green duck feathers and yellow-brown duck feathers flashing among the grass."
"The mute came to Commander Yu with his waist knife and the old Hanyang rifle.His face was frustrated and his eyes were straight.Raise your hand and point to the sun, it has already risen southeast; lower your fingers and point the road, it is empty; the mute pointed at his stomach, screaming, waving his arms, aiming at the direction of the village.Commander Yu pondered for a moment and shouted to the people on the west side of the road: ""Come here!"""
The team members crossed the road and gathered on the river bank.
"Commander Yu said, ""Brothers, if Leng Mazi dares to play tricks on us, I will go and pull his head! It's not too late yet, let's wait for a while. When it's noon, the car won't come yet, so we will go straight to Tanjiawa and settle the score with Leng Mazi. Everyone will rest in the sorghum field first, and I will ask Douguan to go back to urge him. Douguan!"""
My father looked up at Commander Yu.
"Commander Yu said, ""When you go home, tell your mother, and ask her to find someone to roll the cakes. It will definitely be delivered at noon, so that your mother can come to deliver them in person."""
"My father nodded, picked up a pair of pants, inserted his Browning pistol, ran down the river bank quickly, ran a short distance north along the highway, and then got into the sorghum field, swimming towards the northwest.My father encountered several rectangular mule and horse skulls in the sorghum field like sea water.He kicked and jumped out of the skeleton with two short-tailed furry voles. He looked at him for a while without much surprise, and then got into the skeleton.My father remembered the two big black mules in my house again, and for a long time after the road was built, and whenever the southeast wind blew, the pungent stench of corpses could be smelled in the village.In the Moshui River, the corpses of dozens of mules and horses had been soaked and swelled last year.They were anchored in the shallow water of weeds by the river. Their belly was sunny and swollen to the extreme, and they burst into pieces. The gorgeous intestines overflowed like flowers, and dark green juice slowly flowed away with the river."
