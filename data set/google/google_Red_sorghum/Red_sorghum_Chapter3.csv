"This is true. When we built it on Jiaoping Highway, the sorghum in the fields only grew to the height of the waist.On the low dusty plain, which is seventy miles long and sixty miles wide, except for dozens of villages, two rivers and dozens of countryside dirt roads, the green waves are full of sorghum.On the White Horse Mountain in the north of the plain, the white horse-shaped huge rock can be seen clearly on our village.The farmers who hoe sorghum looked up and saw the white horses, and they saw the black soil. Sweat dripped into the soil, and their hearts were so painful!The wind was that the Japanese wanted to build roads in the plains, and the villagers had been anxiously anxiously waiting for the disaster to come."
The Japanese come whenever they say it.
"When the Japanese devils brought the puppet troops to our village to catch the civilians and pull mules and horses, my father was still sleeping.He was awakened by the noise from the soju workshop.Grandma took her father's hand, pulled her two small feet like bamboo shoots, and ran to the soju workshop.At that time, there were more than a dozen large jars in the yard of my soju workshop, which were filled with high-quality white wine, and the fragrance of wine spread throughout the village.Two Japanese in yellow stood in the yard with bayonet rifles.Two Chinese in black were carrying guns and were about to untire two large black mules tied to the elm tree.Mr. Luohan rushed towards the small puppet army who had untied the reins again and again, but was poked back by the big puppet army with a gun barrel again and again.In early summer, Mr. Luohan was wearing only a single shirt, and his exposed chest was covered with purple-red circles poked out by the muzzle."
"Uncle Luohan said, ""Brothers, you have something to say, and you have something to say."""
"The big puppet army said, ""Old beast, get out of the way."""
"Mr. Luohan said, ""This is the owner's animal, and he can't be pulled."""
"The puppet army said, ""If you make a noise, you will kill your brother-in-law!"""
"The Japanese soldiers held guns, like mud gods."
"As soon as my grandmother and my father entered the yard, Mr. Luohan said, ""They want to pull our mule."""
"Grandma said, ""Sir, we are good people."""
The Japanese soldier squinted his eyes and smiled at his grandmother.
"The small puppet army untied the mule and pulled it hard. The mule stubbornly raised its head and refused to move.The big puppet army went up and poked the mule's butt with a gun. The mule raised its hooves angrily, and the bright hooves raked the mud, splashing the puppet army's face."
"The big puppet army pulled the bolt of the gun, pointed the gun at Mr. Luohan, and shouted, ""Old bastard, come and lead it to the construction site."""
Uncle Luohan squatted on the ground without saying a word.
"A Japanese soldier was holding a gun and shaking in front of the Uncle Luohan's eyes. The Japanese said, ""WooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooThe Japanese soldier sent his gun forward, and the quick-first bayonet opened a white hole on the bare scalp of Mr. Luohan."
"Grandma shivered and said, ""Uncle, please take them."""
"A Japanese soldier slowly leaned towards his grandmother.My father saw that the Japanese soldier was a young and beautiful young man, with his big eyes pitch black and shiny. When he smiled, his lips were rolled up, revealing a mouthful of yellow teeth.Grandma stumbled back to Uncle Luohan.The white hole on the Luohan's head was bleeding, and his head was covered in color.The two Japanese soldiers leaned forward with a smile.Grandma slapped the bloody hair of Mr. Luohan twice, then slapped it on his face, tearing his hair apart, opened his mouth wide, and jumped up frantically.Grandma looks like a human and seventy-sixth-sixth-something like a ghost.The Japanese soldiers stopped in shock.The small puppet army said, ""Taijun, this woman is so crazy."""
The Japanese soldier rumbled and shot my grandma in the head.Grandma sat on the ground and started crying.
"The big puppet army forced the Luohan to use a gun.Uncle Luohan took the mule reins from the little puppet army.The mule held his head and his legs trembled, and followed Uncle Luohan out of the yard.Mules, horses, cattle and sheep were running in chaos on the streets."
"Grandma is not crazy.As soon as the Japanese and puppet troops were discharged from the hospital, grandma opened the wooden lid of a urn and saw a terrifying bloody face in the sorghum soybean wine that was as calm as a mirror.When my father saw tears flowing through grandma's cheeks, he turned red.Grandma washed her face with soju and washed a jar of wine red."
"Uncle Luohan and the mule were taken to the construction site.A road tire has been produced in the sorghum field.The roads on the south side of Moshui River have been almost repaired, and big and small cars have squeezed over from the newly repaired road. The car carried stones and yellow sand, and they were unloaded on the southern bank of the river.There is only a small wooden bridge on the river, and the Japanese want to build a large stone bridge on the river.On both sides of the road, two large pieces of sorghum were trampled flat, and the ground seemed to be covered with green felt.In the sorghum field in Hebei, on both sides of the road that had just made it look like black soil, dozens of mules and horses were pulling slaughter. From the sorghum field like sea, two large flat open spaces were pressed out, destroying the green gauze tent closely connected to the construction site.Mules and horses were led by people, walking back and forth in the sorghum field.The tender sorghum broke and fell under the iron hooves. The looming and broken sorghum was repeatedly suppressed by the trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-trough-The various rollers and rollers turned dark green, and the sorghum juice soaked them.A strong smell of seedlings enveloped the construction site."
"Uncle Luohan was rushed to Henan to transport stones to Hebei.He reluctantly handed the mule reins to an old man with bad eyes.The small wooden bridge swayed, as if it was about to collapse at any time.Uncle Luohan crossed the bridge and stood in Henan. A Chinese man, who looked like a foreman, gently poked Uncle Luohan's head with the purple-red vines held in his hand and said, ""Go, move stones to Hebei."" Uncle Luohan wiped his eyes - the blood from his head soaked his eyebrows.He carried a small stone from Henan to Hebei.The old man who was picking up the mule had not left yet, and the uncle Luohan said to him, ""You are precious to you. These two mules belong to my boss."" The old man hunched his head numbly and led the mule into the mule and horse brigade that opened the passage.The black mule's smooth butt reflects sunlight.Still bleeding from his head, Mr. Luohan squatted down, grabbed a handful of black soil, and pressed it on the wound.The heavy dull pain on the top of his head was guided to his ten toes, and he felt his head cracked in half."
"On the edge of the construction site, the Japanese and puppet troops were sparsely standing with guns, and the supervisors holding rattans were circling around the construction site like ghosts.Uncle Luohan walked on the construction site, and the villagers looked at his blood-muddy head, their eyes trembling with surprise.Uncle Luohan carried a bridge stone. After walking a few steps, he heard a gust of sharp wind sounding from behind, and then a long burning pain fell on his back.He threw down the bridge stone and saw the supervisor smiling at him.Mr. Luohan said, ""Sir, you have something to say, why do you hit someone just by raising your hand?"""
"The supervisor smiled and said nothing, raised the rattan and sucked his waist horizontally.Uncle Luohan felt that the vine almost smacked himself in half, and two hot tears protruded from his eye sockets.Blood hit the top of his head, and the scab made of blood and soil collapsed and jumped on his head, as if it was about to burst."
"Uncle Luohan shouted, ""Sir!"""
The commander gave him another rattan.
"Uncle Luohan said, ""Sir, why are you hitting me?"""
"The chief trembled with the rattan in his hand and said with a smile: ""It makes you wink, it's a bitch."""
"Uncle Luohan choked his throat and his tears blurred. He lifted a big stone from the pile of stones and staggered towards the small bridge.His head swelled, and his eyes were covered in white.The sharp edges and corners of the stone pierced his belly and ribs, and he couldn't even feel the pain."
"The supervisor was still moving while leaning on the rattan, while the uncle Luohan moved the stone and walked past him in fear.The supervisor drew another vine around Mr. Luohan's neck.Uncle Luohan lay down in front, holding Dashi, and kneeled on the ground.The stone smashed his hands, his chin blurring blood on the stone.Uncle Luohan was beaten to death and cried like a child.At this time, a purple-red flame slowly lit up in his blank mind."
"He pulled his hand out of the stone with difficulty, stood up, half-bearing his waist, like an old skinny cat showing his might."
"A middle-aged man in his early forties, smiling all over his face, walked to the supervisor, took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, pinched out one, and greeted him to the supervisor's mouth.The supervisor opened his mouth and held a cigarette, and waited for the man to light it for him."
"The middle-aged man said, ""You are old, you don't have to get angry with this piece of wood."""
The supervisor sprayed smoke out of his nostrils without saying a word.The old man saw his burnt fingers holding the rattan twisting urgently.
"The middle-aged man put the cigarette in the supervisor's pocket.The supervisor seemed to be unaware of it, so he snorted, pressed his pocket with his palm, and turned around and left."
"""Brother, are you new here?"" asked the middle-aged man."
Mr. Luohan said yes.
"He asked, ""Didn't you give him some meeting gift?"""
"Uncle Luohan said, ""Unreasonable, dog! Unreasonable, they forced me to catch me."""
"The middle-aged man said, ""It's okay to give him some money or a box of cigarettes, but he doesn't play hard. If he doesn't play lazy, he doesn't play singles."" The middle-aged man joined the migrant worker team."
"For the whole morning, Uncle Luohan was carrying stones desperately, just like he had no soul.The blood scab on the head was shining in the sun, and it hurts hard.The hands are covered in blood.The bones on the chin were injured and saliva kept flowing out.The purple-red flame was ignited in his mind at times, strong and weak, and never extinguished."
"At noon, a yellow car drove up from the road ahead with a roughly driving capacity.He heard a sharp whistle sound in a daze, and saw the half-dead migrant workers swaying towards the car.He sat on the ground, with no thoughts, and didn't want to know what happened to the car.Only the cluster of purple-red flames jumped hotly, buzzing in his ears."
"The middle-aged man came over, pulled him and said, ""Brother, let's go, it's time to eat, go and try the Eastern rice!"""
Uncle Luohan stood up and followed the middle-aged man.
"Several large buckets of snow-white rice were lifted from the car and a large basket filled with blue flowers and white porcelain bowls.A thin Chinese man stood beside the bucket, holding a brass spoon; a fat Chinese man stood beside the basket, holding a stack of bowls.When someone came, he sent a bowl, and the brass spoon was used to put rice into the bowl at the same time.Everyone was eating around the car, without chopsticks, and they all grabbed it with their hands."
"The supervisor turned around again, carrying the rattan, with that calm smile on his face.The flames in Uncle Luohan's mind ignited loudly, and the flames shone clearly on the memories he threw away. He remembered the nightmare experiences that had been happening for a long time.The Japanese soldiers and puppet troops standing guard with guns also gathered over and ate around a white iron bucket.A wolfdog with long ears and long face sat behind the bucket, sticking out her tongue to look at the folks here."
"Uncle Luohan counted the dozen or so Japanese devils and a dozen puppet soldiers who were eating around the bucket, and the idea of ​​running away.If you run, as long as you get into the sorghum field, you won’t be able to catch the dog.Sweat was hot in his feet.Since the idea of ​​running started, his heart became anxious.What seemed to be hidden behind the calm smiling face of the supervisor?When Uncle Luohan saw this smiling face, his mind immediately became confused."
"The villagers were not full.The fat Chinese took back the foreign bowl.The villagers licked their lips and stared at the remaining rice grains in the empty buckets, but no one dared to move them.A mule screamed hoarsely on the north bank of the river.Uncle Luohan heard that it was my black mule calling.In that newly opened clearing, mules and horses were tied to rollers or stone rollers.Sorghum corpses were everywhere.The mule and horse listlessly ate the rubbed and flattened sorghum stems and leaves."
"In the afternoon, a young man in his twenties, watching the supervisor not paying attention and flew towards the sorghum field, and a bullet caught up with him.He lay on the edge of the sorghum field, motionless."
"The sun is flat west, and the yellowish car is coming again.Uncle Luohan finished eating the spoonful of rice.He was used to eating sorghum rice and resolutely rejected this mildewy white rice.But he still endured the spasm in his throat and ate it.The idea of ​​running is getting stronger and stronger.He was thinking about the wine-scented courtyard that belonged to him more than ten miles away.When the Japanese came, all the soju friends ran away, and the steaming soju pot was cold.He is even more concerned about my grandmother and my father.The warmth that grandma gave him by the sorghum leaf pile will be unforgettable for him."
"After dinner, the villagers were driven into a large fence made of wooden poles.There were a few tarpaulins on the fence.The fir poles are all connected together with wire as thick as mung beans.The fence door is welded with half a thick iron rod.The Japanese and the puppet army lived in two tents, which were dozens of steps away from the fence.The dog was tied to the door of the Japanese tent.At the door of the fence, a high rod was planted, and two mast lamps were hung on it.The Japanese and puppet troops took turns to stand guard.Mules and horses were tied to the ruins of the sorghum to the west of the fence.Dozens of horse-tethered stakes were planted there."
"The fence was smelly, some people were snoring, and some people were peeing into the iron bucket on the corner of the fence, and the wall of the bucket was like pearls falling from the jade plate.The light of the mast lamp dimly penetrates into the fence.The long shadow of the flowing whistle sways in the light from time to time."
"The night is getting deeper and the fence is so cold.Uncle Luohan couldn't fall asleep.He still wants to run away.The footsteps of the guards rang around the fence.Uncle Luohan lay down and didn't dare to move, and he fell asleep in a daze.In my dream, I felt a sharp knife on my head and a soldering iron in my hand.When I woke up, my body was sweating all over and my pants were wet.A sharp rooster crow came from the distant village.Mules and horses blow their hooves and noses.A few sneaky stars leaked out from the broken tarpaulin."
"The middle-aged man who helped Mr. Luohan during the day sat up quietly.Although in the darkness, Mr. Luohan still saw his two fireball-like eyes.Uncle Luohan knew that the middle-aged man had a great origin and lay quietly watching his movements."
"The middle-aged man knelt at the gate of the fence, raised his arms and moved very slowly.Uncle Luohan looked at his back and looked at his mysterious head.The middle-aged man used his energy to the side, and grabbed two iron sticks in a row like an arrow.A dark green light shot out from his eyes, and when he touched the object, it seemed to be rustling.The two iron rods opened silently.More lights and starlight shot in from outside the fence door, illuminating someone's broken shoe with his mouth open.Youmoongshou turned around.Uncle Luohan saw a black shadow flying out of the fence, and the Japanese sentry clattered, and fell silently under the support of the middle-aged man's iron arm.The middle-aged man picked up the Japanese rifle and disappeared quietly."
"It took a long time for Mr. Luohan to understand what was going on in front of him.The middle-aged man turned out to be a hero with great martial arts skills.The hero has opened up the road for him, run!Uncle Luohan carefully climbed out of the hole.The dead devil was lying on his back, one of his legs was still thrusting and moving."
"Uncle Luohan climbed into the sorghum field, straightened his waist, followed the ditch, tried his best to avoid the sorghum, without making any noise, and walked up the Moshui River embankment.Samsung is just around the corner, and the darkness before dawn is coming.The stars are brilliant in the river of Ink.Standing crampedly on the river bank, Uncle Luohan was completely cold and his teeth were frequently hit. The pain in his chin bone spread to his cheeks and ears, and was connected with the suppurative pain on his head.The cold free air mixed with sorghum juice entered his nostrils, lungs, and stomach. The two ghostly fire-like mast lamps were lit up in the fog, and the fir fences were black like a huge grave.Uncle Luohan could hardly believe it, and he escaped so easily.His feet took him to the decaying wooden bridge, fish flirting in the water, the water gurgled and the meteors broke through the sky.It seems that nothing happened, nothing happened.Originally, Uncle Luohan could have escaped back to the village, hid, hid, recovered his wounds, and continued to live.However, when he was walking on the wooden bridge, he heard an uneasy mule screaming hoarsely on the south bank of the river.Mr. Luohan returned to the mule, causing a heroic tragedy."
"Mules and horses were tied to dozens of wooden stakes not far from the fence, and under them were filled with the smell of urine and shit.The horse sniffs, the mule chews on wooden stakes; the horse chews sorghum stalks, and the mule pulls on shit.Uncle Luohan fell three times in one step and rushed into the herd of mules and horses.He smelled the friendly smell of the two big black mules in my house, and he saw the familiar figures of the two big black mules in my house.He pounced on him, trying to save his partner, the mule, and this unreasonable beast, turned his butt and flew up his hooves.Uncle Luohan murmured, ""Black mule, black mule, let's run together!"" The mule turned left and right in anger, protecting his territory.They couldn't recognize their masters. Uncle Luohan didn't know that the fresh and old smell of blood on his body and the fresh and old scars on his body had changed himself.Uncle Luohan was upset and stepped in one step. The mule flew up a hoof and hit him on the hip.The old man flew sideways and lay on the ground, half of his body numb.The mule was still sticking out her butt and hitting her hooves, and the hooves were flashing like the waning moon.The Arhat's hips were burning and swollen, and there was a heavy feeling of burden.He got up, fell, fell and got up again.The thin-voiced rooster in the village cried again.The darkness gradually faded, and Samsung became more and more brilliant, and also shining on the shiny mule's butt and eyes."
"""What two beasts!"""
"Uncle Luohan was furious and turned around tilted, trying to find a sharp weapon.On the construction site where the digging water drainage channel was dug, he found a sharp shovel.He walked without restraint, shouted and cursed, forgetting people and dogs a hundred steps away.He is free and not free is because of fear.The gradually rising red glow in the east scattered at the same time as it rose, and the sorghum field before dawn was so quiet that it would explode at any time.Uncle Luohan walked towards the two big black mules in the morning glow.He hated the black mule to the core.The mule stood still and did not move. Uncle Luohan took the shovel flat, aimed it at one of the hind legs of a black mule, and shoveled it hard.A cool shadow fell on the mule's hind legs.The mule tilted twice, immediately held it back, and from the mule's head, there was a rough, violent, shocked and angry hissing sound.Immediately, the injured mule raised his butt high, and threw a stream of blood, like raindrops, dripping over the face of the Luohan.Uncle Luohan seized the opportunity and hit the mule's other hind leg. The black mule sighed, and his butt gradually fell. He sat suddenly on the ground, his front legs were still standing, his neck was hanging straight by the reins, and his mouth called to the gray-blue sky.The shovel was pressed by the mule's heavy butt, and Mr. Luohan also squatted.He tried his best to pull out the shovel.He felt the shovel blade firmly embedded in the mule's leg bone.The other black mule stared at her slumped companion in a daze, moaning like crying and begging for mercy."
"The Luohan Master held up the shovel and rushed towards it. It retreated hard, the reins were almost broken, the wooden stakes were beating loudly, and dark blue light flowed in its eyes as big as the fists."
"""Are you afraid? Beast! Where is your majesty? Beast! You are an ungrateful bastard! You are a foreign dog bastard!"""
"Uncle Luohan cursed angrily and shoveled out a shovel at the rectangular slab face of the black mule.The shovel was shoveled on the wooden stake, and he shook the shovel handle up and down, left and right before pulling out the shovel blade.The black mule struggled, its hind legs bent into bows and arrows, and its bald tail swept the floor and made a sound.Uncle Luohan aimed at the mule's face and a slap sound. The shovel hit the mule's wide forehead. The solid skull collided with the shovel blade. A tremor was transmitted through the shovel handle, which made Uncle Luohan's arms sore and numb.The black mule was speechless, her legs were moving around, and she was crossing and mixed, and she couldn't hold on.Hulong fell down, like a thick wall falling.The reins were broken, half hanging on the wooden stake, and half bent beside the mule's face.Uncle Luohan stood silently with his hands hanging down, and his smooth shovel handle stood diagonally on the mule's head and pointed at the sky.The dogs on the other side were noisy. It was dawn, and a blood-red sunlight appeared from the sorghum field in the east, and the sun shone rightly on the half-open black mouth of the Luohan."
