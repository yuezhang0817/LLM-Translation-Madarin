"On the ninth day of the eighth month of the ancient calendar in 1939, my father, a bandit, was over fourteen years old.He followed the team of Commander Yu Zhan'ao, the legendary hero who was later famous all over the world, to ambush the enemy's car team on the Jiaoping Highway.Grandma wore a jacket and sent them to the village entrance.Commander Yu said, ""Stay."" Grandma stood up.Grandma said to my father, ""Official Dou, listen to your godfather."" My father didn't say anything, and he looked at grandma's tall body.Sniffing the hot scent that emanated from my grandma's jacket, I suddenly felt the cold air.He trembled and his stomach rumbling for a while.Commander Yu patted his father on the head and said, ""Let's go, goddamn."""
"The world is chaotic, the scenery is shady, and the sound of the team's footsteps has sounded far away.A blue and white fog curtain hung in front of my father, blocking his sight. He only heard the sound of the team's footsteps, and there was no sign of the team.The father tightly grabbed the corner of Commander Yu's clothes and moved his legs quickly.Grandma is like the shore is getting farther and farther away, and the fog is like the sea water is getting closer and surging. My father grabbed Commander Yu, like he grabbed a boat's side."
"My father ran towards the wordless bluestone tombstone that belonged to him in the red sorghum field in his hometown.The dead grass was already shining on his grave. Once a boy with bare ass came here with a snow-white goat. The goat slowly gnawed on the grass on the grave. The boy stood on the tombstone, pissed angrily, and then sang loudly: The sorghum is red - Japan is coming - compatriots are ready - fire guns and cannons-"
"Some people say that the boy who herded the sheep is me, and I don’t know if it is me.I once had an extreme love for Gaomi Northeast Township, and once had an extreme hatred for Gaomi Northeast Township. When I grew up, I worked hard to learn Marxism. I finally realized that Gaomi Northeast Township is undoubtedly the most beautiful and ugliest, the most transcendent and secular, the holy and the most disgusting, the hero, the most bastard, and the most capable of drinking and loving.My fellow villagers who live on this land like to eat sorghum and plant in large quantities every year.In late August, the boundless sorghum turns into a vast sea of ​​blood, the sorghum is dense and brilliant, the sorghum is sad and lovely, and the sorghum love is turbulent.The autumn wind is desolate and the sun is very bright. There are plump white clouds wandering in the blue sky, and purple-red shadows of plump white clouds slide on the sorghum.Teams of dark red people shuttle through the sorghum tree, and have been doing the same for decades.They killed people and robbed people and served their country with loyalty. They performed heroic and tragic dance dramas, which dwarfed us, the unfilial descendants who lived, and while making progress, I really felt a deterioration."
"After leaving the village, the team was moving on a narrow dirt road, with the sound of people's footsteps clamping the rustling of broken grass on the roadside.The fog is very thick, lively and changeable.On my father's face, countless dense small water dots condense into large drops of water, and his squeezing of hair stuck to his scalp.My father has long been used to the faint mint smell of wafting from the sorghum fields on both sides of the road, and the bitter and sweet smell of mature sorghum.During this marching in the fog, my father smelled the novel, yellow and red fishy smell.The smell came faintly from the smell of mint and sorghum, evoking a very distant memory deep in my father's heart."
"Seven days later, August 15th, Mid-Autumn Festival.A bright moon rose slowly, and sorghum was standing solemnly everywhere. The ears of sorghum were soaked in the moonlight, like dipping mercury, gurgling. My father smelled countless times stronger than now under the broken moon shadow.At that time, Commander Yu held his hand and walked in the sorghum field. More than 300 villagers folded their arms and were in a mess. The blood flowed out irrigated a large area of ​​sorghum, soaking the black soil under the sorghum into mud, making them slow to pull their feet.The fishy and sweet smell was suffocating. A group of dogs who came to eat human flesh were sitting in the sorghum field, staring at their father and Commander Yu with bright eyes.Commander Yu took out his pistol, and with a swing, his two dog eyes were wiped out; with another swing, he wiped out two dog eyes.The dogs scattered and sat far away, roaring and looking at the dead bodies greedily.The fishy sweetness became stronger and stronger, and Commander Yu shouted, ""Japanese dog! A Japanese dog is raised by a bitch!"" He finished shooting all the bullets at the group of dogs, and the dog ran away without a trace.Commander Yu said to my father, ""Let's go, son!"" The old and the young walked towards the depths of the sorghum in the moonlight.The fishy sweet smell filled with the fields soaked my father's soul. In the more intense and cruel years from now, this fishy sweetness has always accompanied him."
"The stems and leaves of sorghum were screaming in the fog, and the bright noise of the Moshui River passing through this low-lying plain was slowly flowing in the fog, one strong and one weak, one far and one near.I caught up with the team, and there were footsteps and heavy breathings in front of my father.I don't know whose butt stock hit another one's stock.I don't know who stepped on a dead skeleton or something.The man in front of his father started coughing loudly, and the person's coughing sound was very familiar.When my father heard him cough, he remembered his two big ears that were thrilled and congested as soon as he was excited.The transparent, thin, blood vessel-covered large ears are the eye-catching organs on Wang Wenyi's head.He was very small, with a big head huddled among his raised shoulders.My father tried hard to look, his eyes pierced through the thick fog, and he saw Wang Wenyi's big head that was shaking while coughing.My father remembered that Wang Wenyi was beaten in such a pitiful look when he was beaten on the drill field.At that time, he had just joined Commander Yu's team. Adjutant Ren also shouted to him on the drill field: Turn right——Wang Wenyi stomped his feet happily, not knowing where he had turned.Adjutant Ren whipped his butt, and he grinned and screamed: Damn, child!I don't know if it's crying or laughing on my face.The children watching the scene outside the short wall laughed."
Commander Yu flew up and kicked Wang Wenyi in the butt.
"""Cough what?"""
"""Commander..."" Wang Wenyi said as he held back his cough, ""The throat is itchy..."""
"""Don't cough even if it's itchy! I want your head if you expose your target!"""
"""Yes, commander."" Wang Wenyi agreed, and another cough rushed out of his mouth."
My father realized that Commander Yu's hand had loosened from the back of Wang Wenyi's neck. My father also felt that two purple handprints like ripe grapes were left on Wang Wenyi's neck. A few gratitude and grievance burst out in Wang Wenyi's faint blue fearless eyes.
"Soon, the team entered the sorghum field.My father instinctively felt that the team was heading towards the southeast.The dirt road I just walked through is the only road leading directly from the village to the Moshui River.This narrow dirt road is blue and white during the day.The road was originally made of black soil with black oil, but after a long time of trampling, the black was settled to the bottom. How many petal hoof prints of cattle and sheep and semicircular hoof prints of mules, horses, donkeys were printed on the road. Horses, mules and donkeys were like dried apples, cow dung is like pancakes eaten by insects, and sheep dung is like falling black beans.My father often walked this path, and later when he was struggling in the Japanese charcoal kiln, this path often flashed in front of him.My father doesn’t know how many romantic comedies my grandmother has starred in on this dirt road, I know.My father didn't know that on the black soil covered by the shadow of sorghum, I knew that, too."
"After turning into the sorghum field, the fog appears more stagnant, with greater mass and less fluidity. After the human body collides with the object loaded by the human, with the sorghum stalks, with the resentful sound of the sorghum, heavy drops of water droplets fell down.The water droplets were cold and refreshing, and the taste was delicious. When my father looked up, a large drop of water hit his mouth accurately.My father saw the soothing fog, shaking the heavy head of the sorghum.The sorghum was covered with dewy flexible leaves, sawing her father's clothes and cheeks.The little wind caused by the shaking of the sorghum attacked briefly above my father's head, and the sound of the flowing water in the Moshui River became louder and louder."
"My father had played with water in the Ink River. His water nature seemed to be born. Grandma said that he was more anxious when he saw water than when he saw his biological mother.When my father was five years old, he dived like a little duck, with his pink buttocks facing the sky and his feet raised.My father knew that the mud at the bottom of the Moshui River was shiny and soft like oil.On the wet mudflats by the river, there are gray-green reeds and goose-green plantains, as well as wild kudzu vines growing on the ground, and upright bone-tie grass.The silt on the mud flats were covered with the slender claws of crabs.The autumn wind blows and the weather is cool. Groups of geese fly south, sometimes in a row into the character ""one"", sometimes in a row into the character ""people"", etc.The sorghum is red, the west wind is roaring, and crabs are itchy, and groups of crabs, the size of horseshoes, are climbing up the river beach at night and looking for food in the grass.Crabs like to eat fresh cow dung and the corpses of rotten animals.My father listened to the sound of the river and thought about the scene when he followed my old friend, Mr. Liu Luohan, to the river to catch crabs on the autumn night.The night gray grapes are filled with golden winds, the royal blue sky is deep and boundless, and the green stars are particularly bright.Beidou Spoon Star - Beidou Lord Dies, Nandou Duji Star - Nandou Sisheng, Octagonal Glass Well - a brick is missing. The anxious cowherd wants to hang himself, and the sad Weaver Girl wants to jump into the river... They are all hanging on their heads.Uncle Liu Luohan has worked in my house for decades and is responsible for the overall work of my sour wine workshop. My father followed Uncle Luohan and ran back and forth, just like following his grandfather."
"A shirked by the fog, my father's heart lit up with four glass lamps, and the smoke came out of the iron sheet covered by the lamp and the iron sheet drilled.The lights are weak and can only illuminate the darkness in a radius of five or six meters.The water in the river flows into the light shadow, as yellow as ripe apricots, but in an instant, it flows past, and the river water in the dark reflects the stars all day.My father and Mr. Luohan were wearing straw raincoats and sat next to the lamp, listening to the low sobs of the river - very low sobs.The endless sorghum fields on both sides of the river often sounded the excited cry of the fox.The crabs are catching up with lights and gathering together.My father and Mr. Luohan sat quietly, listening to the secret words of the world, and the fishy smell of the mud under the river came up.Crocodiles surrounded them, forming a restless circle.My father was anxious and eager to get up, but was pressed by the Luohan Master.""Don't be anxious!"" said the old man, ""I'm anxious and can't drink hot porridge."" My father suppressed his excitement and remained motionless.The crab crawled into the light and stopped, connecting its head and tail, covering the ground.A blue crab shell was shining, and pairs of round rod-shaped eyes shot out from the sunken eye socket.Hidden under the tilted face, spitting out strings of colorful foam.The crabs spitting out colorful foam to challenge others, and the father was wearing a big straw raincoat and his hair rose up.Uncle Luohan said, ""Catch it!"" My father bounced up and snatched it with Uncle Luohan. Each of them grabbed the two corners of a dense net that had been laid on the ground, lifted a piece of crab, revealing the river beach under the crab.My father and Mr. Luohan tied the two corners and threw them aside, and lifted the mesh with the same speed and skill.Every network is so heavy, and hundreds or thousands of crabs are occupied on the network."
"After my father followed the team into the sorghum field, his heart was walking around with the crabs, and his feet and legs were separated by space, causing the sorghum tree to fall from place to place.His hands always tightly pulled the corner of Commander Yu's clothes, half walking by himself, and half being led by Commander Yu. He felt a little sleepy, his neck was stiff and his eyes were awkward.My father thought that as long as you follow Mr. Luohan to Moshuihe, there is no reason to come back empty-handed.My father was tired of eating crabs, and my grandma was tired of eating them.It tastes tasteless, but it is a pity to discard it. Uncle Luohan used a quick knife to cut the crab into pieces, put it in a tofu mill, grind it into a crumb, add salt, put it in a tank, and make crab sauce. It will eat it over the years of adulthood. If it doesn’t finish it, it will smell bad, and if it smells bad, it will be fed to poppy.I heard that my grandma would smoke smoke but was not addicted, so she always looked like peach blossoms and was refreshing. The poppy flowers fed with crabs were plump and strong, with pink, red and white mixed with fragrance.The black soil in my hometown is surprisingly fertile, so it has abundant resources and excellent race.The people's hearts are high and strong, which is the mentality of my hometown.The white eels produced in Moshui River are as fat as meat sticks, with a thorn from beginning to end.They are stupid and swallow when they see the hook.The uncle Luohan, who was thinking about by his father, died last year and died on the Jiaoping Highway.His body was cut into pieces and thrown into pieces.The skin on the torso was peeled, and the flesh jumped, like a big frog that had faded.When my father thought of the body of Mr. Luohan, his spine ditch became cold.My father remembered another night about seven or eight years ago, my grandmother got drunk. In the yard of my sour wine workshop, there was a sorghum leaf pile. My grandmother leaned on the haystack and hugged the shoulder of the Luohan. She murmured, ""Uncle... Don't leave, don't look at the monk's face, look at the Buddha's face, don't look at the fish's face, and look at the water surface, and don't look at my face, but also look at the bean official's face. Stay behind, you want me... I'll give it to you too... You are like my father..."" My father remembered that the Luohan pushed his grandmother aside, walked into the mule shed, and mixed the ingredients for the mule.My family has two large black mules and a workshop for burning sorghum wine. It is the richest man in the village.Uncle Luohan did not leave and worked as a business leader in my house until the two big black mules in my house were pulled to the construction site of Jiaoping Highway to be in service."
"At this time, from the village where my father and the others were left behind, the cry of donkeys came from the longest.My father was excited and his eyes opened, but what he saw was still semi-solid and translucent mist.The tall stalks of sorghum are lined up into dense fences, vaguely hidden behind the gas, passing through rows after row, endless rows.How long has it been since I walked into the sorghum field? My father has forgotten that his thoughts have been stuck in the noisy and abundant river in the distance, and in the memories of the past for a long time. He has no idea why he hastened into the sorghum field that is as crowded as dreams.My father lost his way.He had an experience of losing his sorghum field the previous year, but he finally came out, and it was the sound of the river that guided him.Now, my father listened to the revelation of the river again and soon realized that the team was heading towards the southeast and towards the direction of the river.After distinguishing the direction clearly, my father understood that this was going to ambush, hit the Japanese, and killing people, just like killing dogs.He knew that the team was going southeast and would soon reach the Jiaoping Highway that was connected north and south, divided the huge low-lying plain in half, and connected the two counties of Pingdu County, Jiao County.This highway was built by the Japanese and their lackeys using whips and bayonets to force the people to make the road."
"The commotion of sorghum became frequent and intense due to people's fatigue and fatigue. The dew fell continuously, wetting everyone's scalp and neck.Wang Wenyi coughed constantly, and even though he was insulted by Commander Yu, he did not correct it.My father felt that the road was about to arrive, and the shadow of the road was shaking in front of him.Before I knew it, some holes appeared in the sea of ​​fog that was connected into one. Sorghum, which was soaked by dew, was staring at my father worriedly in the fog cave, and my father also looked at them devoutly.My father suddenly realized that they were all living spiritual objects.They take root in black soil, are nourished by the sun and the moon, and are moistened by rain and dew. They know astronomy and geography.My father guessed from the color of the sorghum that the horizon, which was blocked by the sorghum, burned into a pitiful bright red."
"Suddenly, the father heard a sharp whistling in his ear, and then heard the sound of something bursting in front of him."
"Commander Yu shouted loudly: ""Who fired? Brother-in-law, who fired the gun?"""
"My father heard the bullet drilling through the thick fog, passing through the sorghum leaves and sorghum stalks, and a sorghum head fell to the ground.For a moment, everyone held their breath.The bullet screamed all the way, not knowing where it landed.The aromatic smoke dissipates into the fog.Wang Wenyi screamed: ""Commander-I have no head-Commander-I have no head-"""
"Commander Yu was stunned, kicked Wang Wenyi and said, ""Damn it! You can still talk without a head!"""
"Commander Yu left my father and went to the front of the team.Wang Wenyi was still wailing.My father came forward and saw Wang Wenyi's strange-shaped face clearly.There was a dark blue thing flowing on his cheek.My father reached out and touched the sticky and hot liquid.My father smelled a fishy smell similar to the silt in Moshui River, but much fresher than the silt in Moshui River.It overwhelms the fragrance of mint and the sweetness of sorghum. It awakens the increasingly approaching memory of my father, and connects the mud of the ink river, the black soil under the sorghum, and the past that will never die and the present that will never be retained. Sometimes, everything will spit out the smell of human blood."
"""Uncle,"" said my father, ""Uncle, you're hushing."""
"""Douguan, you are Douguan. Look, is the uncle's head still growing on his neck?"""
"""Here, uncle, he looks good, but his ears are bleeding."""
"Wang Wenyi reached out to touch his ears, touched the blood in one hand, and after a scream, he collapsed: ""Commander, I'm going to be the lottery! I'm going to be the lottery, I'm going to be the lottery."""
"Commander Yu came back from the front, squatted down, pinched Wang Wenyi's neck, and lowered his voice and said, ""Don't shout, I'll kill you if you call me again!"""
Wang Wenyi didn't dare to shout.
"""Where are you hurt?"" Commander Yu asked."
"""Ears..."" Wang Wenyi said crying."
"Commander Yu pulled out a white cloth like a leather bag from his waist, tear it in half with a snap, and handed it to Wang Wenyi, saying, ""Cover it first, don't make a sound, follow it, bandage it on the way."""
"Commander Yu also called him, ""Police Officer."" When his father responded, Commander Yu took his hand and walked away.Wang Wenyi followed behind hummingly."
"The shot just now was when a big mute man carrying a rake in front of his head accidentally fell down, and the spear on his back went off.The mute is Commander Yu's old friend, a grassroots hero who has eaten ""pickled cakes"" in the sorghum field. One of his feet was injured in his mother's womb and walked around, but it was very fast, and his father was a little afraid of him."
"The heavy fog finally collapsed around dawn as Commander Yu's team crossed the Jiaoping Highway.August in my hometown is a foggy season, maybe it is caused by the low-lying soil.After walking on the road, my father suddenly felt smart and light, and his steps were flexible and vigorous. He let go of the hand that grabbed the corner of Commander Yu's clothes.Wang Wenyi covered his bloody ears with white cloth and cried all over his face.Commander Yu bandaged his ears with thick hands and feet, and even half of his head was covered.Wang Wenyi grinned in pain."
"Commander Yu said, ""You are so lucky!"""
"Wang Wenyi said, ""My blood is flowing, I can't go!"""
"Commander Yu said, ""Bad, it's just like this if you bite a mosquito. You've forgotten your three sons!"""
"Wang Wenyi lowered his head and muttered, ""I haven't forgotten, I haven't forgotten."""
"He was carrying a long-bolt bird gun, and the butt stock was blood-red.The flat iron box containing gunpowder was hanging obliquely on his butt."
"The remaining fog retreated into the sorghum field.The road was covered with a layer of coarse sand, without any footprints, and no one else’s footprints.Opposite the dense sorghum on both sides of the road, the road is desolate and ridiculous, making people feel ominous.My father had long known that Commander Yu's team had only 40 deaf, dumb, lame, and lame, but when these people lived in the village, they were in chaos, as if the whole village was full of soldiers.The team was placed on the road, and more than 30 people shrank into a ball, like a frozen snake.The guns are long and short, including earth cannons, bird guns, old Hanyang, Fang Liu and seven brothers are carrying a big lifting pole that can drive a small weight out.The mute carried a plate of rectangular flat land and twenty-six iron-toothed rakes around it, and three other team members each carried a plate.My father didn't know what the ambush was like, and he didn't know why he had to carry four plates of iron-toothed rakes when he was ambushed."
