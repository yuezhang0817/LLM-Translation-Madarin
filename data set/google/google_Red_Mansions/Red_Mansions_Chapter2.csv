"But Feng Su hurried out to ask with a smile because he heard the conscript from the consignee.Those people just shouted, ""Please come out!"" Feng Su hurriedly said, ""The villain's surname is Feng, not Zhen. Only the son-in-law was surnamed Zhen that day. He has been a monk for a year or two, but I wonder if he asked him?"" Those men said, ""We don't know what's true and false. Because we came to ask him at the order of the great master, he was your son-in-law, so he took you to meet the great master in person to avoid running around."" As he said, Feng Su did not allow him to speak too much, and everyone pushed him away.Everyone in the Feng family was panicked, not sure what the heck was."
"At the second update that day, Feng Su was back and was filled with joy.Everyone asked quickly.He then said, ""It turns out that the newly promoted grandfather of our mansion, Jia Minghua, was from Huzhou, and had once had a relationship with his son-in-law. He just passed by our door. Because he saw that the girl Jiaoxing bought a line, he only acted as a son-in-law here. I returned the reason one by one, and the grandfather sighed sadly. He asked his granddaughter, and I said I had lost the light. The grandfather said, ""It's better, I'll make sure to visit the foreign service."" After saying a word, he gave me two taels of silver before leaving."" After hearing this, the wife of the Zhen family couldn't help but feel sad.No words all night."
"The next day, Yucun sent someone to send two silver and four pieces of brocade to thank the wife of the Zhen family. He also sent a secret letter and Feng Su, and asked the wife of the Zhen family to ask the sister of the Zhen family to make her second house.Feng Suxi was so angry that he wanted to flatter him, so he made a move in front of his daughter. He only used a sedan chair in the night and sent Jiaoxing in.Yucun was happy, and it was not necessary to say that he granted a hundred gold medals to Feng Su. He thanked the wife of the Zhen family for many things, so that he could support her and wait to find out her whereabouts of her daughter.Feng Su went home and said nothing."
"But it is said that Jiao Xing, the maid, was the one who looked back at Yucun that year.It was a surprise that I had an unexpected chance to have this incident because of accidental consideration.Who would have thought that he had a good fortune and had no hope of coming to Yucun, and he had a son in just one year. After half a year, Yucun's legitimate wife suddenly fell ill, so Yucun helped him to be his wife.It is:"
"Occasionally, I became the best because of a mistake."
"It turned out that after Yucun gave silver to Shiyin that year, he got up and entered the capital on the 16th day. At the time of the competition, he was very proud and had already become a Jinshi and was selected as a foreign class. Now he has been promoted to the prefect of our prefecture.Although they have good talents, they are a bit greedy and cruel; and they rely on their talents to insult their superiors, all of them look at each other.Within a year, his boss found a gap and wrote a book, which he said, ""He was cunning in love, good at compiling etiquette, and was also famous for his reputation as a pure and righteous person, but secretly formed a tiger and wolf family, causing trouble in the place and the people's lives to be unbearable.""Long Yan was furious and immediately criticized him for dismissal.As soon as the department's documents arrived, all the officials of this office were happy.Although Yucun felt very ashamed, he had no resentment on his face and was still smirking. He had confessed to official business and sent some of the capital accumulated by officials over the years to his hometown and arranged for compromise, but he was the one who carried the wind and moon to visit the world's best sightseeing."
"That day, I occasionally swam to Weiyang again, and I heard that Lin Ruhai, the one who is now in charge of this year, was the political point.Lin Ruhai's surname is Lin's name, and his name is Hai. His courtesy name is Ruhai. He is a former child. He has now been promoted to the doctor of Lantai Temple. He was originally from Gusu. He is now appointed as the Yan Yan Censor, and he has been appointed for more than one month.It turns out that the ancestor of Lin Ruhai once attacked the marquises, and now he has arrived in Ruhai, and has been practicing for five generations.At first, he only inherited the three generations. Because of his great kindness and virtue, he has gone from previous generations to his previous generations and added grace. As for the father of Ruhai, he has been born in the imperial examination.Although it is a family of Zhongding, it is also a family of scholars.It’s a pity that the Lin family’s sects are not prosperous and their descendants are limited. Although there are several families, they are just church members with Ruhai, and there are not many relatives who are in charge of the legitimate sects.Now Ru Hai is forty years old and has only one three-year-old son, but he died last year.Even though there were several concubines, he was destined to have no children, so there was nothing he could do.Only his legitimate wife, Jia, has a daughter with a nickname Daiyu, who is only five years old.The husband and wife have no children, so love is like a treasure. When he sees him smart and elegant, he also wants him to read a few words, but he just pretends to be an adopted son, which makes him sigh at the desolation of his knees."
"Yucun was just a matter of time when I was feeling cold and the disease was in the hotel, and the situation was gradually healing in a month.One is because of fatigue and the other is because of the lack of effort. I am also trying to find a place to match it, so I will take a break for the time being.Fortunately, two old friends also lived in this area. When I heard that Ji Zheng wanted to hire a Xibin, Yucun entrusted his friends to get in and made a plan to settle down.The beauty is that there is only one female student and two maids accompanying her. This female student is young and extremely timid. She has no limit on the number of work classes, so she saves effort."
"It was only another year, but the mother of the female student, Mrs. Jia, died in a sanity.The female student served soup and received medicine, and was mourned and mourned, so she said that she would leave the house again.Lin Ruhai wanted to ask the girl to keep reading, so he left him behind.Recently, due to the sad and sadness of a female student, she was originally cowardly and sickly, and she suffered from the old symptoms, so she never went to school for several days.I am bored in the idle village. Whenever the wind is sunny and sunny, I will come out to walk leisurely after dinner."
"On this day, I came to the outside of the countryside, hoping to appreciate the scenery of the village.Suddenly, I walked to a place surrounded by mountains, with spirals and lush forests and deep bamboos. There was a temple faintly. The alleys were tilted, the walls were rotten, and there was a forehead in front of the door, with the words ""Zhitong Temple"" inscribed. There was an old and broken couplet beside the door, saying:"
"I forgot to shrink my hands behind me, and I had no way to look back."
"Yucun looked at it and thought: ""Although these two sentences are simple, the meaning is deep. I have also swam through some famous mountains and rivers, but I have never seen this topic. I guess there must be one who has passed by somersaults, so why not try it?"" Thinking of walking in, there was only one old monk who cooked porridge there.When Yucun saw it, he didn't care.When he asked him a few words, the old monk was deaf and dull, his teeth fell and his tongue was dull, and his answer was not what he asked."
"Yucun was impatient and still came out, intending to go to the village shop to buy three cups to help with wild fun, so he came on foot.When he was about to enter the Simen, he saw a drinker on the seat who stood up and laughed, picked it up, and said, ""Adventure, An adventure."" When Yucun was busy watching, this person was Leng Zixing, a trader in the antique business in the capital, and he met in the capital in the past.Yucun praised Leng Zixing as a person with great skills. Zixing also used Yucun's reputation as a gentleman, so the two of them spoke in an opportunistic manner, which was most in line with each other."
"Yucun asked with a smile, ""When will I come here? I don't know. I met by chance today, which is a strange fate."" Zixing said, ""I got home at the end of last year, and now I am going to enter the capital. From then on, I will find a friend to say something, inherit his feelings, and keep me for two more days. I don't have to worry about it, so I will linger for two days, and I will get up in the middle of the month. Today, my friend has something to do, so I can walk here and rest. I don't expect this to happen!"" While saying that, Yucun sat in the same seat and put on some wine and food.The two chatted and drank, and talked about the matter after parting."
"Yucun asked, ""Is there any news in the capital recently?"" Zixing said, ""There is no news. But old man, you are the same clan family and have a small strange thing."" Yucun smiled and said, ""No one in my brother's clan is in the capital, so why talk about this?"" Zixing said, ""You have the same surname, aren't the same clan family?"" Yucun asked whose family it was.Zixing said, ""Has the family in Rongguo Mansion also insulted the gentleman's family?"" Yucun smiled and said, ""It turned out to be his family. If it comes to the rise, there are many people in the Han clan. Since the Eastern Han Dynasty, the tribes have flourished and all provinces have them. Who can find them carefully? If it comes to Rongguo Mansion, it is the same. But we cannot connect with his glory, and it has become increasingly difficult to recognize it."""
"Zixing sighed, ""Don't say that, old man. Nowadays, the two gates of Ningrong are all dark and shining, which is no better than the previous situation."" Yucun said, ""The population of Ningrong houses was also very large, so how could it be shining?"" Leng Zixing said, ""That's right, it's a long time to say."" Yucun said, ""Last year, I went to the territory of Jinling. I wanted to visit the ruins of the Six Dynasties. That day, I entered Shitou City and passed by his old house. The east side of the street is Ningguo Mansion and the west side of the street is Rongguo Mansion. The two houses are connected, and they occupy most of the streets. Although there is no one in front of the gate, they look through the walls. The halls and pavilions inside are still magnificent. Even the trees, mountains and rocks in the gardens in the back area are still full of lushness and moistness. Where is it like a declining house?"" Leng Zixing said, ""It's your fault.""He was born as a Jinshi, but it turned out to be unfamiliar!The ancients said: 'The insect of a hundred feet will die without being stiff.'Although it is not as prosperous as before in his previous years, the mood is different compared to the ordinary family of officials.Nowadays, life is becoming more and more prosperous, and there are many people who are rich and honored, and there are no one who plan to plan; their daily expenses cannot be frugal.Although the outside is not very bad, the inner pockets are all over.This is still a small matter. There is another big thing: Who knew that the family of Zhongming and Ding Food, the family of calligraphy, and the children and grandchildren are now worse than the generation!""Yucun heard that, he also said, ""How can such a family of poetry and rituals be bad for education?I don't know that it is said that Ning and Rong are the most capable of educating children."""
"Zixing sighed, ""What we are talking about is these two families. When I tell you, Duke Ning and Duke Rong were two brothers. Duke Ning was the eldest and gave birth to four sons. After Duke Ning died, Jia Daihua attacked the official and raised two sons: his eldest name was Jia Fu, and he died at the age of eight or nine. Only his second son Jia Jing was left. Now he is always good at the Tao and only loves to burn elixir and refine mercury. None of the rest is in his heart. Fortunately, he left a son in his early years, named Jia Zhen, because his father wanted to be a god.Immortal, let him attack the official.His father refused to return to his original hometown, and only went to the Taoist priests outside the capital.This Zhen gave birth to a son, who was only sixteen years old this year, named Jia Rong.Now Jing Dad doesn't care about anything.Zhen's place is willing to study, but he just couldn't be happy. He turned over Ningguo Mansion, and no one dared to come and care about him.Let's talk about Rong Mansion, and the strange thing he said just now has come out here.Since Rong Gong's death, the eldest son Jia Daishan attacked the official and married himThe lady of Shixun Shihou's family in Jinling was a wife and gave birth to two sons: the eldest son Jia She and the second son Jia Zheng.Dai Shan has long passed away, and the eldest son Jia She is still alive, and the eldest son Jia She is attacking the official; the second son Jia Zheng has been fond of studying since he was a child, and his ancestors and fathers are most in love with him. He originally wanted to be a senior student. Unexpectedly, when Dai Shan was dying, the emperor immediately ordered his eldest son to attack the official, and asked how many sons he had, and immediately introduced him, so he gave him an additional title of chief official, so he asked him to join the department to study.Now he has been promoted to Yuanwailang.Wang, the wife of Zheng Dad, was the first son of the son of Jia Zhu. He entered school at the age of fourteen and married his wife and had children less than 20 years old. He died of illness.He gave birth to a young lady in the second child, and was born on the first day of the Lunar New Year. This is strange. Unexpectedly, he gave birth to another son the next year, which is even more strange. As soon as he fell out of his fetus, he held a piece of colorful and crystal-clear jade in his mouth, with many handwriting on it, so he named Baoyu.Do you think it is a new and strange thing?"""
"Yucun smiled and said, ""It's really strange. I'm afraid this man has a big origin."" Zixing sneered, ""Everyone said this, so his grandmother loved him as a treasure first. At that time, when he was one year old, Dad Zheng wanted to test his future ambitions, so he put countless things in the world and grabbed him. Who knew that he would not take anything, and reached out to grab only some makeup, hairpins and rings. Dad Zheng was furious and said, ""The future is a drinker and sweet person!"" So he was very displeased. Only the old lady Shi still had the same life. It's strange that he is now seven or eight years old, although he is naughty and strange.Often, but his intelligence is less than one hundred.When he speaks a child, he said, ""The daughter is made of water, and the man is made of mud. When I see my daughter, I feel refreshed; when I see a man, I feel the foul smell is stinking. 'Do you think it's funny? In the future, the perverts will be undoubtedly! ""Yucun Hanran said quickly, ""No! It's a pity that you don't know the origin of this person. The senior Zheng also mistakenly treated the perverts as a pervert. If you hadn't read more books and understand things, and gained the power of learning the truth and understanding the mystery, you wouldn't know."""
"Seeing that he was saying such a big deal, Zixing hurriedly asked for advice.Yucun said: ""Heaven and earth are born, and there are two kinds of great benevolence and evil. The rest are not very different. If the benevolent, they will be born in the fate, and if the great benevolence, they will be born in the disaster. Fortune is born in the world, and the catastrophe is born in the danger. Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, Zhou, Zhao, Confucius, Meng, Dong, Han, Zhou, Cheng, Zhang, Zhu are all born in the fate. Chiyou, Gonggong, Jie, Zhou, Shihuang, Wang Mang, Cao Cao, Huan Wen, An Lushan, Qin Hui, etc., are all born in the disaster. Great benevolence is to cultivate the world; great evil is to disrupt the world. Qingming and beautiful, the righteous spirit of the world, and benevolentIt is the evil spirit of heaven and earth, and the evil spirit of evil spirit.Now it is the dynasty of the prosperous and eternal dynasty, and the peaceful and inaction of the world. The qi of the clear and bright spirit is everywhere from the court to the grass and wilderness.The remaining elegant spirit is nowhere to go, and it is nectar, a gentle wind, and irrigation of the four seas.The cruel and eerie evil spirit cannot overflow in the bright sky, and then condense into deep troughs and ravines. Occasionally, the wind is swayed or destroyed by clouds, and it has a slight shaking and touching feeling. If a sliver of a thread is leaked out, it will occasionally be the elegant spirit of the spirit, and it will be right.If evil is not tolerated, evil is jealous of righteousness, and the two are not inferior to each other, it is like Feng Shui and thunder. Once encountered in the earth, it cannot be eliminated or given up. It must be exhausted after the fight is launched.Therefore, its energy must be given to people and dispersed at the end.If men and women are born with this energy, they will not be able to become a kind man and a gentleman, and they will not be able to be a great evil.If they are placed among millions of people, their smart and elegant aura will be above millions of people; their eccentric and evil attitudes are below millions of people.If they are born in a wealthy family of princes and marquis, they will be a seed of infatuation; if they are born in a poor family of poetry and books, they will beHe is a master of good scholars; even if he is born in a poor family in Bozuo, he will never be a strong servant, and will be driven by mediocre people, and he will be promoted to a good reputation.For example, Xu You, Tao Qian, Ruan Ji, Ji Kang, Liu Ling, Wang Xie clans, Gu Hutou, Chen Houzhu, Tang Minghuang, Song Huizong, Liu Tingzhi, Wen Feiqing, Mi Nangong, Shi Manqing, Liu Qiqing, Qin Shaoyou, and Ni Yunlin, Tang Bohu, Zhu Zhishan, and Li Guinian, Huang Banchuo, Jing Xinmo, Zhu Wenjun, Hongfu, Xue Tao, Cui Ying, Chaoyun and others. These are all people who change their places and are the same."""
"Zixing said, ""According to you, 'If you succeed, the king will be defeated, the thief will be defeated.'"" Yucun said, ""That's exactly what you mean. You don't know, since I was dismissed, I have also met two strange children. So, as soon as you talk about this treasure jade, I guessed that eight or nine are also this kind of person. Needless to say, in Jinling City, the imperial envoy, the president of the Jinling Provincial Tyrant Academy, do you know?"" Zixing said, ""Who doesn't know! The Zhen Mansion and the Jia Mansion are old relatives, and they are family relatives. The two families are extremely intimate. So I have been in contact with his family for only one day."""
"Yucun smiled and said, ""Last year, I was in Jinling, and someone recommended me to the Zhenfu Office. I went in to see the scene, but who knew that the noble family was a wealthy and polite family, but it was a rare restaurant. But this student, although he was enlightened, was more troublesome than a career. It was even more ridiculous to say, he said, ""I must have two daughters to accompany me to study so that I can recognize the words and understand them in my heart; otherwise I will be confused."" He also often talked to his little ones.The servants said: 'The word ""daughter"" is extremely noble and pure, and is even more honorable than the two treasures of Amitabha and Yuanshi Tianzun! Your turbid and bad tongue must not be abrupt.Whenever you want to say it, you must first rinse your mouth with clean water and fragrant tea;if you make a mistake, you must cut your teeth and cut your cheeks and other things.'He is cruel, impetuous, naughty, stupid, and all kinds of abnormalities.As soon as I left school, I went in to see those daughters, and I was kindPeaceful, intelligent and elegant, he has become a different person again.Therefore, he ordered the Zun to beat Chu several times, but he couldn't change it.Whenever he was beaten, he screamed ""sister"" and ""sister"" in his arms.Later, he heard the daughters tease him: ""Why are you so anxious to beat him and just ask for mercy? Are you sorry for your sisters? ""You're not ashamed of you!"" He answered the best. He said: ""When he was in a hurry, he only called ""sister"" and ""sister""The words may be relieved by pain. After calling out, I felt that the pain was no longer painful, so I got the secret method: Every time the pain was extremely painful, I even called my sisters up.'Is it ridiculous?Because my grandmother was spoiled and I was not sure, and because my grandmother was insulted by my teacher, I resigned from the library.Now I have built a library in the Lin family of the Yan Jingshi.You see, these children must not be able to follow the foundation of my grandfather and follow the rules of my teacher.It’s a pity that a few sisters in his family are rare."""
"Zixing said, ""Even in the Jia Mansion, the three are not bad. The eldest daughter of Zheng Dad, named Yuanchun, was selected into the palace as a daughter's wife because of her virtuous, filial piety and virtue. The second lady was born to pardon her father's concubine, named Yingchun; the third lady was born to Zheng Daddy, named Tanchun; the fourth lady was born to Ningfu Zhenye, named Xichun. Because Mrs. Shi loves her granddaughter very much, she is studying with her grandmother, and she hears it well."" Yucun said, ""The more wonderful lies in the customs of the Zhen family, and the name of the daughter is also named after the man's name, not like other families using other beautiful characters such as ""chun"", ""red"", ""scent"", ""yu"", ""however,"" the Jia Mansion also falls into this cliché?"" Zixing said, ""It's not. It's just that the young lady was born on the first day of the first lunar month, so she is named Yuanchun, and the rest are following the word ""chun"". The previous generation also came from brothers..The current evidence: Now, your wife of Mr. Lin, the sister of Mr. Zheng in Rong's Mansion, was named Jia Min when she was at home.If you don't believe it, you can tell if you go back and visit it carefully.""Yucun patted the table and smiled and said, ""It's strange that this female student reads the word ""min"" in every book, and they all read it as ""mi"". When she writes, she will cut one or two strokes. I feel a little confused. Now I hear you say that this is undoubtedly because of this.I wonder if my female student is the same in words and behaviors.She is not the same as the woman in recent days. She will definitely be extraordinary in her mother before she can get her daughter. Now she knows that she is the grandson of Rong's Mansion, which is not rare, but she will die last month.""Zi Xing sighed, ""There are four old sisters, one is very small, and it is gone.The older generation of sisters are gone.Just look at this younger generation, what about the east bed in the future?"""
"Yucun said, ""That's right. Just now, this Zheng Gong already has a son with a jade titular title, and a weak grandson left by his eldest son. All this old man was successful?"" Zixing said, ""After Zheng Gong had a jade titular title, his concubine gave birth to another one, but he didn't know what was wrong with it. He only had two sons and one grandson in front of him, but he didn't know what to do in the future. If you ask, then Zheng Gong also had two sons, Jia Lian, the eldest son, who is now twenty years old, and he married his nephew of Zheng's father, Wang's wife.My daughter has been married for two years.The one who is donated to study, and she is unwilling to study. She is very quick and easy on the road to the world, so she only lives in the house of Mr. Naishun Zheng, helping with some housework.Who knew that after marrying him, no one in the world praised his wife. Mr. Lian backed back: she looked very beautiful, spoke with great cleverness, and was very scheming, and was actually a man who was not as good as that."""
"After hearing this, Yucun smiled and said, ""You can tell that my preface is not wrong. The people you and I just mentioned are all those who come along the way from the two poems of good and evil, and it is unknown."" Zixing said, ""Whether evil or righteous, you only care about calculating other people's accounts, you should eat a glass of wine."" Yucun said, ""That's right, just talk, and even consuming a few more cups."" Zixing said, ""When you talk about other people's gossip, it's just right to drink, and it's okay to eat a few more cups."" Yucun looked out the window and said, ""It's too late, so I close the city carefully. Let's go into the city and talk again slowly, it's not bad."" So the two stood up and returned the bill.When he was about to leave, someone behind him shouted, ""Brother Yucun, congratulations! I'll report a happy message."" When Yucun looked back, he looked-up-"
