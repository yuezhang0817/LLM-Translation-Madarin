"This is the first chapter of the book.The author said: After experiencing a lot of dreams, he hid the true story and wrote this book ""Stone Records"".Therefore, it is called ""Zhen Shiyin"" and so on.But what is recorded in the book and who is?He said again: ""Now the world is mediocre and nothing has been accomplished. I suddenly thought that all the women who were on that day were carefully examined and thought that their actions and knowledge were above me. Why are my dignified and not as good as those who were dressed and hairpins? If you are ashamed, you will have more than anything else, and regret is useless! At this time, you will want to make up the past grace of heaven and ancestors, and when you are rich and silk, you will be happy and fat, you will be grateful for the kindness of your father and brother, and you will be responsible for the discipline of your teachers and friends, and you will be punished by your skills and have been in trouble for half your life. A collection of, to tell the people of the world: My sins are inevitable, but there are people in the boudoir. We must not protect our own shortcomings because of my unfilial piety and make them disappear together.Even today's thatched rafters, tiled stoves and ropes, the morning and evening wind and dew, and the steps and willows and flowers, there are no ones that can hinder my mind.Although I have not learned and have no writing, why not use false words to express a story to make the boudoir famous, and can also please the eyes of the world and destroy people's depressedness. Isn't that appropriate?""So it is said to be ""Jia Yucun"" and so on."
"In this chapter, the words ""dream"" and ""illusion"" are used to remind readers of their eyes and are also the original purpose of this book."
"Dear readers: Where do you think this book comes from?Although the root cause is almost ridiculous, it is very interesting to read it carefully.Only by noting this origin below can the readers be clear."
"It turned out that when Nuwa was refining stones to repair the sky, she refined 36,501 stubborn stones on Wuji Cliff of Dahuang Mountain to 12 ft. and 24 ft.The Emperor Wa only used 36,500 yuan, and only one piece left was left without use, so she abandoned it under the Qingge Peak in this mountain.Who knew that after the practice of this stone, its spirituality had been realized. Seeing that all the stones were able to replenish the sky, I was not able to be selected, so I complained and felt ashamed day and night."
"One day, just as he was mourning, he saw a monk coming from afar, born with extraordinary character and different spirits. He came to the peak and sat by the stone and talked loudly.First, we talk about the fantasy things about the clouds, mountains, fog, seas, gods, and immortals, and then we talk about the glory and wealth in the world.After hearing this stone, it was unconsciously touched the ordinary heart, and wanted to go to the world to enjoy this glory and wealth. But I hated myself for being stupid, so I had no choice but to speak up and said to the monk: ""Master, my disciple is stupid, I cannot be treated with politeness. I heard that the two talked about the glory and prosperity of the world, and I admired it very much. Although my disciple is stupid, my nature is slightly versatile. Moreover, seeing that the two masters are immortal, they are certain to be extraordinary, and they must have the material to replenish the heavens and the world, and the virtue of benefiting people. It is like having a little kindness,He took his disciples into the world, enjoyed in that rich and gentle land for a few years, and should always cherish his kindness and never forget his disasters.""After hearing this, the two immortal masters smiled and said, ""Good, good! There are some joys in the world, but they cannot be relied on forever;and there are also eight words ""There are shortcomings in the world, and there are many good things,"" and the eight words ""were connected to each other, and in an instant, they are extremely happy and sad. People are not changed. After all, they are dreams in the end and all things return to emptiness. It is better not to go."""
"Shi Fan's heart was already burning, and he could hear this and asked for another slightest request.The two immortals knew that they could not be forced, so they sighed, ""This is also a very quiet thought that moves, and there is a number of things that are created out of nothing. Since this is the case, we can take you to enjoy the enjoyment, but don't regret it when you are not satisfied."" Shi said, ""Natural, natural."" The monk said, ""If you say that you are spiritual, but you are so stupid, and there is no special thing. You have to tiptoe. Well, I am now offering great Buddhist teachings to help you, and when the end of the calamity, I will return the essence to this case. Are you okay?"" Shi Tou heard it, thanked me.The monk chanted mantras and talismans, showed off his magic, and immediately turned a big stone into a bright and clean piece of jade, and then shrank it into a copeco as big as a fan pendant.The monk held it on his palm and smiled and said, ""The body is also a treasure! There is no real benefit. You must engrave numbers again so that people can know it is a wonderful thing at first sight. Then take you to the prosperous country, the tribe of poetry, the family of treasures, the prosperous land of flowers and willows, and the gentle and rich land to settle down and enjoy the work."" When Shitou heard this, he was happy and could not stop it, so he asked, ""I don't know the strange places I gave to my disciples, but I don't know where to take my disciples? I hope I will make it clear that my disciples will not be confused."" The monk smiled and said, ""Don't ask, you will understand naturally in the future."" As he said that, he put on the stone and floated away with the Taoist, not knowing where to go."
"Later, I don’t know how many lifetimes and disasters have passed, because a Taoist Kongkong visited the Tao to seek immortality, and suddenly passed by the Qinggeng Peak of Wuji Cliff in the Great Wilderness Mountain. Suddenly, a large stone was clearly written and compiled.Taoist Kongkong looked from the beginning and found that it was a story about the world without any material to repair the sky, the illusion of the world, the vast master and the real person of Miaomiao were carried into the world, and the separation, joy and sorrow, and the cool world.There is another verse behind it:"
"There is no material to replenish the sky, and it will be a waste of time to enter the world.This is the past and afterlife. Who will remember to write a legend?"
"After the poem, this story of the stone fell and reincarnation was personally experienced.Among them, the trivial matters of the family and the leisurely poems are still complete, which may be fun to relieve boredom; however, the age of the dynasty, the geography and the country are lost without any examination."
"The Taoist Kong Kong then said to Shitou: ""Brother Shi, this story is a bit interesting according to you, so I wrote it here to write it. In my opinion, the first one is that there is no age to be tested in the dynasty; the second one is that there is no good governance of the great wise and loyalty to govern the customs of the court. There are only a few strange women, some of whom are infatuated, some are small and small, and they are not as good as Ban Gu and Cai. Even if I copy it, I am afraid that the world will not like to read it."" Shitou replied with a smile: ""Why is my teacher so stupid! If there is no dynasty to be tested, what is the difficulty of my teacher applying for the ages of the Han and Tang Dynasties? But I think that all the unofficial history has been the same, so what is the best way to doI am not using this trick, but it is novel and unique. But it is just a matter of fact. Why should I be confined to the age of the dynasty?Furthermore, there are very few people in the market who like to read books about governance, and there are many people who like to be comfortable and idle.In history, there are countless people who slander the king and minister, or demote the wife and daughter, and rape and viciousness.There is also a kind of romantic and romantic writing, which is obscene and dirty, slaughtering the poison, and ink, and bad people's children.As for books such as beautiful and talented men, there are thousands of books, and they are all in one set, and they must be involved in sexual abuse, so that Pan An, Zijian, Xizi, and Wenjun are all over the paper. However, the author wants to write his own two love poems and erotic poems.Therefore, if you want to describe the names and names of men and women, a villain must be next to them to make trouble, just like the clown in the play.What is the meaning of the maid and maid opening their mouths is not the truth.Therefore, when you look at them one by one, they are all contradictory and unreasonable, which is not as good as the women I have seen and heard in half a lifetime. Although I dare not say that they are like all the people in the previous books, the truth can also be relieved. There are also a few familiar poems that can spray rice and drink.As for separation, joy, sorrow, rise and fall, the situation of the rise and fall, they will follow the traces, and they will not dare to make a little fool of themselves, and they will lose their true teachings only for the sake of giving people's eyes.Today, people are poor and are burdened by food and clothing every day, while those who are rich are alsoI have a lack of heart, even if I have a little idle time, I have greed for lust, love sex, and seeking sorrow. Where can I have time to read the book of governance?Therefore, I don’t want the world to be a wonderful person, nor do I have to be happy to read this story. I just hope that when I am drunk, lying down, or avoiding things and worrying, I will save some life force?It is more than that of the ignorant plan, but also saves the harm of right and wrong, and the hardship of running legs and feet.Moreover, it also allows the world to change its eyes, no more than those old manuscripts that are familiar with, such as those who are full of talented people, Zi Jianwenjun, Matchmaker Xiaoyu, etc. What does my teacher mean?"""
"When Taoist Kong Kong heard this, he thought for a while and reviewed the ""Stone Record"" again. He saw that although there were some words above that criticized the traitor, blamed the slander, defamed and punished the evil, it was not the intention of hurting the times and scolding the world. As for the monarch, benevolent ministers, kind fathers, and filial sons, all the ethics are all about praise and praise, and their concerns are endless, which is not comparable to other books.Although the general idea of ​​the relationship is just a record of the matter, it is not a false statement. It is comparable to blindly invite sexual intercourse and privately signing alliances.Because he did not interfere with the times, he copied it back from beginning to end and came up with a legend.From then on, the Taoist Kong Kong saw color because of emptiness, and sent emotions into color. He realized that he was the love monk, and changed the name of ""The Stone Record"" to ""The Record of Love Monk"".In the Eastern Lu Kong Meixi, the title is ""Fengyue Baojian"".Later, Cao Xueqin read in Daohongxuan for ten years, added and deleted five times, compiled a catalog, and divided the chapters into a chapter, and wrote it out. The title was ""The Twelve Beauties of Jinling"".And the title is a masterpiece:"
"A full of absurd words, a handful of bitter tears.It’s all said that the author is crazy, who can understand the taste of it!"
"When you come out, you will be clear, let’s look at what the story is on the stone.According to the book on the stone, it says:"
"On that day, the land was trapped in the southeast. There was a place called Gusu and a city called Changmen in this southeast corner, which was the most prosperous and romantic place in the world.There is a Shili Street outside this Changmen, there is Renqing Alley in the street, and an ancient temple in the alley. Because the place is narrow, everyone calls it a gourd temple.Next to the temple is a village official, whose surname is Zhen, whose name is Fei, and whose courtesy name is Shiyin.The legitimate wife Feng was virtuous and wise.Although his family was not very rich, he was also recommended to be a prominent family in the local area.Because Zhen Shiyin is calm and does not think about fame and fame. He only enjoys watching flowers and bamboo, drinking wine and reciting poems every day, which is a first-class character of immortals.It's just one shortcoming: I am now fifty years old, I have no children under my knees, only one girl, nicknamed Yinglian, and I am only three years old."
"One day, in the hot summer, Shi Yin sat idle in the study room, and when his hands were tired of throwing books, he lay down for a few rests, and fell asleep without realizing it.When you dream of one place, you can’t tell where it is.Suddenly, I saw a monk and a Taoist coming from the side, and I was talking all the time."
"The Taoist asked, ""Where did you want to go after you brought this stupid thing?"" The monk smiled and said, ""Don't worry, there is a romantic case now that it is time to be settled. This romantic enemy has not yet been reborn into the world. Taking this opportunity, he will carry this stupid thing in it and let him experience it."" The Taoist said, ""It turns out that the romantic evil will be ruined in the past few days? But I don't know where to go?"" The monk smiled and said, ""This is funny, it is a rare thing that has never been heard of in the ages. It is because there is a red pearl grass on the banks of the Three Lives Stone on the banks of the Ling River in the West. At that time, there is a red pearl grass at the Heixia Palace Shenying, who is irrigated with nectar every day. This red pearl grass has been prolonged for a long time. Later, after being nourished by the essence of heaven and earth, he is nourished by rain and dew, and he has been able to get rid of the grass-womb wood.He changed his human form and only cultivated a female body. He traveled outside the heaven of resentment all day long. When he was hungry, he ate honey and green fruits for food, and when he was thirsty, he drank and poured sorrow for soup.Just because he had not yet received the virtue of irrigation, he had a lingering meaning in his five senses.Recently, the attendant of Shenying was a man who was always in a bright mind. He took advantage of this to make peace in the world and wanted to come down to earth to create a illusion. He had already registered his name in front of the fairy Jinghuan case.Jinghuan also asked that the irrigation feelings were not paid, and he could take advantage of this to settle.The fairy Jiangzhu said, 'He is the favor of nectar, and I have no such water to return.Since he was a human being in the next life, I also went to the next life to be a human being, but he could repay all the tears of my life to him.'For this reason, he had hooked up many romantic enemies and accompanied them to settle the case.'"
"The Taoist said, ""It's rare to hear. I have never heard of any more tears. I think this story is more trivial and delicate than the past romantic accidents."" The monk said, ""There are several romantic figures who have always been passed down and their poems. When they drink and eat in the family boudoir, they have never been recorded. Furthermore, most of the stories of romantic stories are just stealing fragrance and jade, secretly making an appointment to elope, and they have never vented their true feelings. I want to enter the world., the love of the ghost, the wise and foolish, are all different from those of the predecessors.""The Taoist said, ""Why don't you and I go to the next world to save a few people?Isn't that a merit?"" The monk said, ""It's just my wish.Let me go to the palace of Jinghuan Fairy and hand over the stupid things clearly. When this romantic ghost has finished his life, you and I will go again.Although half of it is now in the dust, there is still no complete collection.""The Taoist said, ""Since that's the case, let's go with you."""
"But Zhen Shiyin all understood it, but he didn't know what the ""stupid"" was.Then he couldn't help but step forward to salute and asked with a smile: ""The two immortal masters have asked."" The monk and Taoist also hurriedly answered the greeting and asked.Shi Yin said, ""I heard the cause and effect that the immortal master talks about is rare in the world. But the disciples are foolish and cannot understand it. If they are ignorant and stubborn, they should be careful and listen carefully. If they can listen carefully, they can also avoid the pain of sinking."" The two immortals smiled and said, ""This is a mystery that cannot be revealed. At that time, don't forget yourself and you will jump out of the fire pit."" Shi Yin was not inconvenient to ask again after hearing this.He smiled and said, ""The mystery cannot be revealed, but it is said that it is a stupid thing. For some reason, may it be seen at first sight?"" The monk said, ""If you ask about this thing, you will have a chance to meet you."" As he said that, he took it out and handed it to Shi Yin."
"When Shi Yin followed it, it turned out to be a piece of bright and beautiful jade, with clear handwriting on it, engraved with the four words ""Spiritual Jade"" and a few lines of small characters behind it.Just as he was about to take a closer look, the monk said that he had reached the illusion, so he forced himself to snatch it from his hand and passed a large stone arch with the Taoist, with four big words written on it, which was ""Taixu Illusion Realm"".There is another couplet on both sides, and the saying is:"
"When falsehood is true, the truth is also false, and there is no place where there is nothing."
"Shi Yin wanted to follow him, and when he was just taking a step, he suddenly heard a thunderclap, as if the mountain collapsed and the earth was sinking.Shi Yin shouted and looked closely and saw that the sun was scorching and the banana trees were rising. He forgot most of the things he dreamed of.I saw the wet nurse carrying Yinglian again.Seeing that his daughter was getting more and more beautiful, Shiyin felt happy, so he reached out to pick her up, held her in his arms, teased him for a while, and took her to the street to watch the lively fun after a while."
"When he was about to come in, a monk came from there: the monk had a bald head and a slutty head, and the monk had a sloppy head, crazy and squandered, chatting and laughing.When he arrived at his door, he saw Shi Yin holding Yinglian. The monk burst into tears and said to Shi Yin: ""Donor, why are you holding this thing that has no fate and has no luck in your arms?"" After hearing this, Shi Yin knew it was crazy and ignored him.The monk also said, ""Let me give me aside, let me give me aside!"" Shi Yin was impatient, so he took his daughter and retreated to go in. The monk pointed at him and laughed, and recited four words in his mouth:"
"I am so mean to laugh at you as a fool, and the flowers are so beautiful that they are facing the snow.It is best to prevent the Lantern Festival after the Lantern Festival, and it is time for smoke and fire to be put out."
"Shi Yin could understand and hesitate in his heart, intending to ask them about their origin.I heard the Taoist say, ""You and I don't have to go with you, so I will break up and go to the business of each other. After three disasters, I will wait for you in Beim Mountain and we will all go to Taixu Illusion Realm to close the account."" The monk said, ""The most wonderful, the most wonderful!"" After saying that, the two of them left and there was no trace again.Shi Yin thought to himself at this moment: These two people must have origins, and it should be a question, but it is too late to regret it now."
"Shi Yin was thinking about it when he suddenly saw a poor scholar living in the gourd temple next door, a man named Jia, a man named Biao Shifei, and alias Yucun, who was born in the gourd temple next door, walked out.Jia Yucun was originally from Huzhou and was also a family of poets, books and officials. Because he was born in the last days, his parents and ancestors had finished their foundations and their population declined. Only he was left with his body and mouth, which was useless in his hometown. He went to Beijing to seek fame and fortune and then made up his foundation.Since he came here for the previous year, he was once again stuck in the temple and temporarily stayed in the temple. He sold his characters and wrote essays every day to make a living, so Shi Yin often handed over to him."
"When Yucun saw Shiyin, he hurriedly greeted and said, ""The old man leaned against the door and looked at him. Do you dare to have any news on the street?"" Shiyin said, ""No. It's because the little girl cried and led him out to play. It was very boring. Brother came in a good mood. Please go to Xiaozhai to talk, so that each other can spend the whole day forever."" As he said that, he asked someone to send his daughter in and came to the study with Yucun.Children offer tea.After talking for a few words, the family suddenly reported, ""Master Yan is here to pay my respects."" Shi Yin hurriedly stood up and apologized, ""Forgive the crime of liar, sit down, and I will come to accompany you."" Yucun hurriedly stood up and asked, ""I'm asking for help. I'm a regular guest. I'm a guest for a while, so why not wait?"" As he said that, Shi Yin had already left the front hall."
"Here, I am rummaging about books to relieve my boredom.Suddenly, he heard a woman coughing outside the window. Yucun got up and looked out the window. It turned out to be a maid, picking flowers there, with a good look and clear eyebrows and eyes. Although he was not very beautiful, he was also charming.Yucun was stunned."
"The maid from Zhen's family picked up the flowers and was about to leave. When she suddenly looked up, she saw someone in the window. She had a worn-out scarf and old clothes. Although she was poor, she had a round waist, thick back, wide face, square mouth, and a sword-eye eyebrow, starry eyes, and straight nose and cheeks.The maid quickly turned around and avoided it, thinking to herself: ""This life is so majestic, but so ragged. I think he must be what my master often says about Jia Yucun. I always intend to help Zhou Ji, but I don't have much chance. My family does not have such poor relatives and friends, so I think it must be this person. The strange saying also said that he must not be a person who has been trapped for a long time."" Thinking about it like this, I couldn't help but look back twice."
"When Yucun saw him turn around, he was so ecstatic that the woman was interested in him. He thought that the woman must be a giant-eyed hero and a confidant in the world.The boy came in and Yucun asked about the food in front of him and could not wait for a long time, so he went out of the corridor.After Shiyin was dispersed, he knew that the rain village would take advantage of it and would not invite him again."
"One day, the Mid-Autumn Festival is the morning.After the Shiyin family banquet was finished, he had another seat in the study room, but he walked to the temple to invite the rain village.It turned out that Yucun had looked back at the Zhen family maid twice since that day, and was a confidant, so he always cared about his heart.It is Mid-Autumn Festival again, and I can't help but have a crush on the moon, so I just say that it is all about five words:"
"Unrecognizable wishes for three lifetimes add up to a lot of sorrow.When you come, you will keep your forehead tight and look back a few times.Looking at the shadows in front of the wind, who can bear the moon falling?If the toad light is interested, go to the Jade Man Tower first."
"After chanting in the rain village, I thought about my life's ambitions. Before the time came, I scratched my head and sighed at the sky, and chanted a couplet again:"
Jade is in the box and the hairpin is waiting for the time to fly.
"Just as Shi Yin came over and heard it, he smiled and said, ""Brother Yucun is really ambition!"" Yucun said, ""I just recite the sentences of the predecessors, why dare to be so crazy?"" He asked, ""Why did the old man come here?"" Shi Yin said, ""Tonight, Mid-Autumn Festival, is commonly known as the ""Festive of Reunion"". I want to respect my brother to travel to the monk's room, and it is not without the feeling of loneliness, so I specially drink it and invite my brother to drink it in my vegetarian room. I wonder if I can accept the celery?"" After hearing this, Yucun did not refuse, and smiled and said, ""Since I am grateful for my love, why dare to dispel this kind of affection."" As he said that, he came back to the academy with Shi Yin."
"After a moment of tea, I had already set up a cup and plate, so there was no need to say about the delicious wine and food.The two of them sat back, first drinking, and then they became more excited, and they didn't realize that the flying cups were limited.At that time, every household in the neighborhood had flutes and sings. The moon was flying and the colorful lights were shining. The two of them became more and more prosperous, and they were drunk to drink.Yucun was already drunk at this time, and he was so excited that he was filled with thoughts about the moon, and his slogan was awesome:"
"When it comes to three or five, you will be reunited, and the sunny jade railing is covered with jade.It was only after the world was picked up in the sky, and all the people on earth looked up."
"After hearing this, Shi Yin shouted, ""How wonderful! I always say that my brother must not be the one who has been living under someone for a long time. Now the sentence I have recited is already seen, and I can walk on the clouds and rainbows soon. I can congratulate you, congratulate you!"" So I poured a bucket of congratulations.Yucun sighed because he did it, ""It's not that I'd say crazy after drinking. If you talk about fashion studies, I can go and make up for fame. But now I'm at a loss when traveling, and the road to Shenjing is far away, so I can get it by selling my words and writing articles."" Shi Yin didn't wait to finish it, so I said, ""Why don't you say it early? I always have this heart, but whenever I meet my brother, I didn't talk about it, so I dare not be abrupt. Now that I'm not talented, I still know the word ""righteousness and profit"". I also like to be a big contest next year, so I should enter the capital quickly. In the spring battle, I will not let my brother down. I will deal with the rest of my life, so I will not miss my brother's misunderstanding!"" I immediately ordered the child to go in and quickly sealed fifty taels of silver and two sets of winter clothes.He also said: ""The 19th day is the ecliptic period. You can buy a boat to the west and wait for the hero to fly high and meet again tomorrow winter. Isn't that a great pleasure?"" Yucun collected the silver clothes, but thanked him a little, and didn't mind, and he was still drinking and chatting.The third update was handed over that day, and the two of them were separated."
"After Shiyin sent Yucun to the room, he went back to his room and woke up until he was noon.Because I thought about what happened last night, I wanted to write two more letters of recommendation and Yucun took it to Shendu, so that Yucun could visit a family of officials as a place to send a place to send a place.When he sent someone to invite him, the family went back and said, ""The monk said that Mr. Jia had already entered Beijing for the Five Drums today, and he also left a message to the monk to convey to the master, saying, ""Scholars are not in the zodiac and gangster, and they always take the truth as the key, and they are not enough to say anything in person."" After hearing this, Shi Yin had no choice but to do so."
"It’s really easy to pass in the idle place, and it’s the Lantern Festival again.Shiyin ordered his family member Huo Qi to carry Yinglian to see the spark lanterns of the club. In the middle of the night, Huo Qiyin wanted to explain his feelings, so he placed Yinglian on the threshold of the family and sat.When he came to hug him after he was relieved, was there any trace of Yinglian?Huo Qi was so anxious that he searched for him in the middle of the night. When he disappeared, Huo Qi did not dare to come back to see his master, so he fled to a foreign land.When the Shiyin and his wife saw that their daughter did not return overnight, they knew something was wrong. They asked a few people to search for her, but when they came back, they all said that they had no sound.The husband and wife only gave birth to this daughter for half a lifetime. Once they are lost, they will not think about it. Therefore, they cried day and night, and almost never sought death.After a month of checking, Shi Yin first got sick; at that time, the Feng family also asked for medical treatment because they thought of their daughter."
"I didn't expect that on March 15th, the monks were not careful, causing the oil pan to burn the window paper.People who use bamboo fences and wooden walls in this place are probably due to disasters, so they will burn a street like a mountain of flames.Even though there were military and civilians who came to save the fire at that time, the fire had become a force. How could it be saved?After burning it all night, it gradually went out. I don’t know how many of the houses I burned.It’s just that the Zhen family is next door, and it has already burned into a rubble field.Only his and his wife and a few families had never been injured.Shi Yin was so anxious that he only sighed after falling.I had to discuss with my wife and go to the farm to settle down.In recent years, there has been no harvest in floods and droughts. Rats and bees have risen, and they are nothing more than robbing the fields and robbing the land. Rats and dogs have robbed them, and the people are uneasy, so it is difficult for the officers and soldiers to suppress and arrest them.Shiyin had no choice but to change the farmland and took his wife and two maids to his father-in-law's house."
"His father-in-law named Feng Su, who was originally from the state. Although he was a farmer, his family was still well-off.Now that I saw my son-in-law coming in such a mess, I felt a little unhappy.Fortunately, Shi Yin had not used up any money for the land that had been replaced, so he took it out and asked him to buy some real estate at a low price, which was the plan for food and clothing in the future.Feng Su would coax and make half profit, and he had to share some thin fields and rotten houses.Shi Yin was a scholar and was not used to physical health and farming. He barely supported him for a year or two, and became poorer.Whenever Feng Su met, he would say some ready-made words, and he blamed them for not being good at living, and he just kept talking about food and laziness.Shiyin knew that he could not accept others, and he felt regretful. He was shocked and angry and resentful, and had accumulated injuries. In his old age, people who were poor and sick, gradually revealed the scene of the next life."
"But this day, when I was struggling to relax in front of the street with a crutch, I suddenly saw a limp Taoist coming over there, and was madly falling off, wearing a quail dress, and chanting a few words inside, saying:"
"Everyone in the world knows that gods and immortals are good, but they can’t forget their fame and fortune!Where are the generals and ministers of ancient and modern times?A pile of grass was gone in the deserted tomb.Everyone in the world knows that gods are good, only gold and silver cannot be forgotten!All day long I regretted that I had not gathered much, and I closed my eyes for a long time.Everyone in the world knows that gods are good, but only beautiful wives cannot forget them!You say kindness on your birthday, and you go with others when you die.Everyone in the world knows that gods are good, but only children and grandchildren cannot forget it!There have been many infatuated parents since ancient times, but who has seen them with filial children and grandchildren?"
"After hearing this, Shiyin came up and said, ""What are you saying? You can only hear some ""good""."" The Taoist smiled and said, ""If you hear the word ""good"" you understand. You know, it's all in the world. It's good, it's good. If you can't, it's bad. If you don't, it's bad. If you want it, it's good. My song is called ""Good Song"". ""Shiyin originally had Su Hui, but when he heard this, he had already realized it in his heart.He smiled and said, ""Stay! How about I annotate your ""Good Song""?"" The Taoist smiled and said, ""You understand, you understand."" Shi Yin said,"
"The humble room and empty hall were filled with scepters at that time; the decayed grass and withered poplars were once a singing and dancing venue.The spider silk is full of carved beams, and the green gauze is now pasted on the bulging window.What do you say is that the fat is strong and the powder is fragrant, and how can the temples become frosty again?Yesterday, white bones were sent to the loess ridges, and tonight, mandarin ducks were lying under the tents of red lights.The box is full of gold and silver, and all beggars are slandered.Just as I sigh that others don’t live long, I know that I’m going to die when I return!If you have good training, you may not be able to become a strong man in the future.If you choose a good fortune, who will hope to live in the fireworks alley!Because I think the gauze hat is small, I carry the shackles; I feel sorry for the coldness of the porch, but now I think the purple python is long: You just finished singing and I will appear, but I believe that the foreign land is my hometown.It's very ridiculous. In the end, it's all about making wedding clothes for others!"
"After hearing this, the crazy limp Taoist clapped his hands and smiled, ""It's so clear, it's so clear!"" Shi Yin said, ""Let's go!"" He snatched the bag on the Taoist's shoulder and carried it on his back, but he didn't go home, and floated away with the crazy Taoist.Now that the neighbors are stirred up, everyone regards it as a news legend.When Feng heard this letter, he cried to the death. He had to discuss with his father and sent people to visit him everywhere. How could he seek news?Helplessly, he had to rely on his parents to live.Fortunately, there were two old maids around him serving, the master and servant, who sold some needles and threads day and night to help his father with their expenses.Although Feng Su complained every day, he had no choice but to do anything about it."
"On that day, the eldest maid from Zhen’s family was buying a line in front of the door, and suddenly heard a shouting on the street, and everyone said that the new master was in office.When the maid hid in the door, she saw the military prison passing by one by one, and the sedan chair carried a black hat and a robe over the government office.The maid was stunned, thinking that this official was kind-hearted, and she seemed to have seen him there.So when I entered the room, I threw it away.At night, just as I was resting, I suddenly heard a sound of sound from the door, and many people shouted, ""The great master of this mansion sent someone to ask for it."" Feng Su was stunned when he heard it, not knowing what was wrong, so let's listen to the next episode of the decomposition."
