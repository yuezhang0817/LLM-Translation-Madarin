"But when Yucun looked back, it was not someone else, but Zhang Rugui, the one who participated in the case of a colleague that day.He was originally from here, and after the rebellion, he found out that the capital had reported the letter of restoration of the old staff. He went around to search for love and find a way. Suddenly he met Yucun, so he hurriedly expressed his joy.When the two saw the greeting, Zhang Rugui told Yucun the letter. Yucun was happy and hurriedly said a few words, then said goodbye to each other and went home.Leng Zixing heard this and hurriedly offered advice, causing Yucun to disturb Lin Ruhai and turn to the capital to disturb Jia Zheng.Yucun took the idea and said goodbye to the museum, and hurriedly searched for the residence to report the truth."
"The next day, I was planning it like the sea.Ru Hai said: ""According to the fate of heaven, the mother-in-law in the capital family thought that her daughter had no one to support her. She had sent a boat to pick her up, but because her daughter had not recovered, she had not done anything. At this moment, she was thinking that she had not been rewarded for her teachings. She would not be able to repay her with her heart when she encountered this opportunity. But please rest assured. I have planned this and have compiled a letter of recommendation. I have transferred my brother to a comprehensive assistant so that I can do my best to pay my respects. Even if I have made some money, I have already stated it in my brother's letter, so I will not ask my brother to pay more attention."" Yucun was beating and thanking her, but she was also notified.He asked again: ""I don't know what position I am currently in? I'm afraid I'm born in a rash later, so I dare not enter the capital Gandu suddenly."" Ruhai smiled and said, ""If it comes to giving up his relatives, he is still in the same genealogy as his elder brother, and he is the grandson of Rong Gong: his elder brother has now inherited a first-class general, named Sam, and his courtesy name Enhou; his second elder brother is Zheng, and his courtesy name Cunzhou, and he is currently a member of the Ministry of Works. He is humble and kind, and has a great tradition of his grandfather. He is not a kind of rich and careless official, so his younger brother has written a letter to him. Otherwise, he will not only be a filthy brother, but he will not even be disdainful."" After hearing this, Yucun believed in the words of Zixing yesterday, so he thanked Lin Ruhai again.Ru Hai said, ""I have chosen to leave the second day of the month and enter the capital. My brother will go there together. Wouldn't it be a good idea?"" Yucun obeyed the orders and felt very proud.Ruhai then brought some gifts and gave him farewells, and Yucun took them one by one."
"The female student Daiyu was in good health, and she couldn't bear to abandon her father and left. Unfortunately, his grandmother gave me a message to her, and Ruhai said, ""Your father is about to be fifty years old and has no intention of reuniting her room. Moreover, you are sick and very young. You are not well-educated by your parents, and you have no support from your sisters and brothers. Now you are by your grandmother and your uncle sisters, which is just enough to reduce my worries. Why don't you go?"" After hearing this, Daiyu said goodbye and said goodbye to her tears, and followed the wet nurse and a few old women in the Rong Mansion to board the boat.There is another boat in Yucun, carrying two children, and walking with Daiyu."
"One day when I arrived at the capital and entered Shenjing, Yucun first dressed, brought a child, took the famous letter from his clan, and went to the door of Rong Mansion to bid.At that time, Jia Zheng had read his sister's book and hurriedly invited him to meet him.Seeing that Yucun was tall and had good words, Jia Zheng liked scholars the most, respecting the virtuous and inferior, helping the weak and helping the poor, and having a great style of ancestors. Moreover, he was greeted by his sister, so he treated Yucun with preferential treatment, which was even more different, so he tried his best to help.On the day of the introductory work, he gently planned to have a reinstatement. Within two months, the Yingtian Prefecture in Jinling was released, so he planned to make up for the gap. He resigned from Jia Zheng and took office on a date.It's no problem."
"Let’s talk about Daiyu’s abandoned her boat and landed on the shore that day, a vehicle that Rongguo Mansion had sent out the sedan chair and pulled her luggage for a long time.Lin Daiyu often heard her mother say that his grandmother's family is different from other families.The food, clothing and expenses he had seen recently were already extraordinary, not to mention that he had arrived at his home now.Therefore, he is careful every step, always caring, and is unwilling to say a word or walk a step, for fear that he will be ridiculed."
"Since I got into the sedan chair and entered the city, I looked out from the screen window and saw that the prosperity of the streets and the prosperity of the people were different from other places.After traveling for another half a day, I suddenly saw two big stone lions squatting in the north of the street, three beast-headed gates, and there were about a dozen people with gorgeous clothes sitting in front of the gate.The main door is not open, and there are only people entering and leaving the east and west gates.There is a plaque above the main gate, with five big words written on it: ""Imperially build Ningguo Mansion"".Daiyu thought, ""This must be the eldest wife of the grandfather."" Thinking of it, he went west again, not far away, and there were still three gates, which was Rongguo Mansion.But he didn't enter the main entrance, but only entered the west corner gate.The sedan chairman carried it in, walked into the shooting place, and when he was about to turn, he stopped and retreated.The mothers behind had already gotten out of the sedan chair and came forward.Zhou Quan's 17 or 18-year-old servant came up and lifted up the sedan chair.The whole woman walked down and fell down at the door of a hanging flower.The servants retreated, and the women came up to raise the curtains and helped Daiyu get out of the sedan chair.Lin Daiyu held the old man's hand and entered the hanging flower door. On both sides were the hand-papered veranda, and there was a large marble screen on the ground.Turning around the screen, there are three small halls, and behind the hall is the main room courtyard behind it.The five upper rooms on the front are all carved beams and painted buildings, and on both sides the wings of the mountain corridors, there are various colors of parrots, thrushes and other birds.On the Taiji Rock, there were a few girls in red and green sitting. When they saw them coming, they hurriedly greeted them and said, ""The old lady was still chanting, but it happened to be."" So three or four people rushed to open the curtain cage, and heard someone reply, ""Miss Lin is here."""
"When Daiyu entered the room, she saw two people holding an old mother with silver hair coming up, and Daiyu knew that it was his grandmother.When Fang wanted to pay a visit, his grandmother had already been hugged in his arms, and he started crying with his heart and soul.At that moment, all the people standing at the ground covered their faces and cried, and Daiyu couldn't stop crying.For a moment, everyone slowly stopped persuading, and Daiyu paid homage to her grandmother.——This is what Leng Zixing called the Taijun of Shi, and the mother of Jia She and Jia Zheng.At that moment, Jia Mu pointed to Daiyu one by one: ""This is your eldest aunt; this is your second aunt; this is your eldest brother Xianzhu's daughter-in-law Zhu's sister-in-law."" Daiyu had met him one by one.Jia Mu said again: ""Please come, girls. The distant guests have just arrived today, so there is no need to go to school."" Everyone agreed and went two."
"After a while, three nannies and five or six maids came surrounded by three sisters.The first one has slightly plump skin, a moderate figure, a fresh cheek, a greasy nose, a gentle and silent, and a friendly look.The second one is to cut shoulders and waist, long and pick a figure, have a duck-like face, handsome eyes and eyebrows, look at it and fly, and have a bright and colorful literary essence, forget the vulgarity when you see it.The third one is not strong enough, and describes it as being still small.The three of them have the same makeup.Daiyu hurriedly got up to greet her and greeted each other. She recognized each other and sat down.The maids poured tea.But let me talk about how Daiyu's mother got sick, how to ask for medical treatment and how to die and die.Unable to help Jia Mu became sad again, and said, ""Your mother is the only one who loves me. Once I leave me first today, I can't even see you. Why don't I be sad when I see you now?"" As she said that, she hugged Daiyu in her arms and started to sob again.Everyone was relieved and explained, but Fang Lei stopped a little."
"When everyone saw that Daiyu was young, her behavior was good and her body was timid and weak, she had a natural romantic attitude, so she knew that she had shortcomings.He asked, ""What medicine should I take? How can I not rush to treat it?"" Daiyu said, ""I have always been like this. From taking medicine when I was able to eat food, I have not stopped today. How many famous doctors have been invited to prescribe medicines, but they have not been effective. When I was three years old that year, I heard a bald monk who came to me and became a monk. My parents refused to follow. He also said, ""I can't bear to give up him, I'm afraid that his illness will not be cured in my life. If it is to be cured, I will never cry until then. Except for my parents, no one can see anyone with a relative or friend of other surnames, and I will be safe in this life."" He was crazy and said these unreasonable talks, but no one paid attention to him. Now he still takes ginseng Yangrong Pills."" Jia Mu said, ""It's right, I'm making pills here. Just ask them to make one more ingredient."""
"Before he could finish his sentence, he heard someone laughing in the backyard, saying, ""I'm late and never welcomed guests from afar!"" Daiyu said, ""These people all held their breath and held their breath, so respectful and strict. Who is the person coming? So rude?"" When he thought to himself, he saw a group of wives and maids surrounded a man and came in through the back door.This person dressed differently from the girls: his colorful embroidery is brilliant, like a fairy in the Godly Concubine.On his head, he was wearing a golden silk eight-treasure pearl bun, and a five-phoenix hanging pearl hairpin on his sunset; on his neck were wearing a red gold plate and a dragon necklace circle; on his skirt, he was wearing a bean-green palace belt, a double-fat rose pendant; on his body, he was wearing a golden butterfly, a narrow-sized jacket with a large red satin and a colorful silk-carved blue silver mouse jacket; on his bottom was a jade-scattered flower-scattered skirt.A pair of Danfeng triangular eyes, two curved willow leaves hanging eyebrows, slim figure and coquettish body.The pink face is full of spring power and the red lips are not revealed, and the red lips are just smiling before they start to smile.Daiyu quickly got up to meet him.Jia Mu smiled and said, ""You don't recognize him. He is a famous rogue and dilapidated man here. In the southern province, you just call him ""Feng Lazi""."
"Daiyu was not sure what she called her, but all the sisters hurriedly told him, ""This is Sister Lian."" Although Daiyu didn't know her, she had heard her mother say that Jia Lian, the son of her uncle Jia She, married the niece of her second aunt Wang, who had pretended to be a man since she was a child, and her scientific name was Wang Xifeng.Daiyu hurriedly smiled and greeted her, calling her ""sister-in-law""."
"Xifeng took Daiyu's hand and strode it over and down, and then sent it to Jia Mu to sit down. She smiled and said, ""There is such a beautiful person in the world, and I have only seen him today! Moreover, this whole body is not like the granddaughter of the ancestor. He is actually a legitimate granddaughter. He can't blame the ancestor for verbal words every day. I just feel sorry for my sister's miserable life, why did my aunt die!"" As she said that, she wiped her tears with a chew.Jia Mu smiled and said, ""I'm done, you come and call me. Your sister has just arrived far away and is weak, so she persuaded me. I'm about it soon. ""When Xifeng heard this, she turned sad and happy and said, ""That's right! When I saw my sister, I was full of my heart on him. I liked and was sad, and I even forgot my ancestors. It's time to fight, it's time to beat me!"" He hurriedly took Daiyu's hand and asked, ""How old is my sister? But have I been to school? What medicine is now taken? Don't miss home here, just tell me what to eat and play; if the girls and wives are not good, just tell me."" At the same time, she asked the mothers: ""Have Miss Lin's luggage and things been moved in? How many people have you brought here? You can clean two rooms early and let them take a break."""
"When I was talking, I had already put up tea fruits.Xifeng personally held the tea and fruits.I saw my second aunt ask him again, ""Have you let go of the monthly money?"" Xifeng said, ""The monthly money has been released. I just took the people upstairs to find satin. I have searched for the past half day, but I haven't seen what my wife said yesterday. I think it's because my wife remembered it wrong?"" Mrs. Wang said, ""Is there any, it's important?"" He said, ""It should be taken out two of you to cut clothes for your sister. I'll ask someone to get it later in the evening, but don't forget."" Xifeng said, ""I'm going to take this first. I know that my sister has arrived in the past two days. I've prepared to go and send it to you when the wife returns. ""Mrs. Wang smiled and nodded without saying a word."
"At the moment, the tea fruit had been removed, and Jia Mu ordered the two old ladies to take Daiyu to meet her two uncles.At that time, Jia She's wife Xing also stood up and replied with a smile: ""I took my niece over there, it's a good deal."" Jia Mu smiled and said: ""That's right, you can go too, there's no need to come here."" Mrs. Xing agreed to the word ""yes"", and then took Daiyu and Mrs. Wang to say a word.Everyone sent it to the hall."
"After leaving the Chuanhuamen, the servants had already pulled a green cart in the green tent. Mrs. Xing took Daiyu and sat on it. The women put down the curtains of the car. Fang ordered the servants to lift it up and pull it to the wide place. Fang drove up and trained mules. He also went out of Xijiaomen, passed the main gate of Rongfu east, and entered a black oil gate and came down in front of Yimen.The servants retreated and then raised the curtain of the car. Mrs. Xing held Daiyu's hand and entered the yard.When Daiyu travels to her house, she must be separated from the Rongfu Garden.When you enter the third floor ritual gate, you will see that the main room and the veranda are all small and unique, not like the magnificent place just now; and there are all trees, mountains and rocks everywhere in the courtyard.As soon as he entered the main room, many concubines and maids with beautiful clothes were greeted by him. Mrs. Xing asked Daiyu to sit down, and while ordering someone to go to the study outside to invite Jia She.A moment later, people said back and forth, ""The master said, ""I have been in bad health for several days. I feel sad when I see the girls, and I can't bear to meet each other for the time being. I advise the girls not to be sad and miss homesick, and to follow the old lady and aunt, that is, the same as the family. Although the sisters are clumsy, they can also relieve some boredom. Or if there are any grievances, just say it, don't be heretics."" Daiyu stood up quickly and listened one by one.After sitting for a moment, he said goodbye."
"Mrs. Xing left for dinner, and Daiyu smiled and replied, ""My aunt cherished her meal, but she should not refuse, but she still wanted to go to see her second uncle, for fear that she would be disrespectful to take her again. I will take her again in the future. I hope my aunt will forgive her."" Mrs. Xing heard that, she smiled and said, ""That's true."" Then she ordered two or three nannies to send the girl over with the car just now.So Daiyu said goodbye.Mrs. Xing sent it to Yi's door and told everyone a few more words, just as the car went there, the only way back."
"For a moment, Daiyu entered Rong Mansion and got off the car.The nanny led it to the east and passed through an east-west hall. After the hall to the south, there were a large courtyard inside the Yimen Gate, five main rooms above, and the wing rooms on both sides were lush and magnificent. It was different from the place where Jia Mu.Daiyu knew that this place was a serious inner room, a large corridor, and went directly out of the gate.When I entered the main hall, I looked up and saw a large plaque with red gold, nine dragons and green land. The plaque had three big characters written on it, which were ""Rongxi Hall"", and there was a line of small characters: ""A certain year, month and day, the letter was given to Duke Rong Jia Yuan"", and there was also ""The treasure of Wanji Chen's Palace"".On the large red sandalwood carved dragon table, there is a three-foot-high blue-green bronze tripod, hanging a large painting of the ink dragon waiting to leak. On one side is the golden eagle and on the other side is the glass.There are two 16 nanmu chairs on the ground, and there is another couplet, which is an ebony couplet, inlaid with silver engraved handwriting, and the words are:"
"The pearls on the seat shine on the sun and the moon, and the mist and clouds are shining in front of the hall."
"The following line of small characters says: ""The brother of the fellow countryman Xun inherited the handwritten letter from the Prince of Dong'an, Mu Shiba."""
"It turned out that Mrs. Wang often stayed in a banquet, but she was not in this main room, but in the three ear rooms east of this main room.So the old nanny led Daiyu into the east room.The big kang next to the window is covered with scarlet wands, with a big red money python backrest, a stone blue money python pillow, and a large autumn-scented money python mattress.A pair of small plum blossom-style lacquer tables are set on both sides.On the left, there is a box of King Wen's casket, spoon, chopsticks, incense box; on the right, there is a table of beauties in Ru kiln - the goblet is filled with fresh flowers, tea bowls, phlegm boxes and other items.There were four chairs on the west side of the ground, all of which were covered with silver-red flower-spreading chairs, and four pairs of footsteps underneath.There are also a pair of high tables on both sides of the chair, and a few tables with tea bowls and bottles.The rest of the furnishings need not be explained in detail."
"The old nannies asked Daiyu to sit on the kang, but there were two brocade mattresses on the edge of the kang. Daiyu ranked in the seats, so she did not go to the kang, but sat on the chair to the east.The maid in this room hurriedly brought tea.Daiyu was eating tea while trying to forgive these maids, dressing and behavior, which was different from other families.Before I could eat the tea, a maid wearing a red silk jacket and green satin vest came and smiled and said, ""Ms. Lin said, let me sit there."" After hearing this, the old lady led Daiyu out again and went to the three small rooms in the east corridor."
"There is a kang table horizontally on the front kang, with books and tea sets on the table, and a half-old green satin backrest pillow on the east wall.Mrs. Wang sat in the west, and also had a half-old green satin backrest.Seeing Daiyu coming, he went east.Daiyu thought that this was Jia Zheng's position.Seeing that there were three chairs on the kang and half-old ink-rolling chairs, Daiyu sat on the chair.Mrs. Wang took him to the kang again, and he was sitting by Mrs. Wang.Mrs. Wang said, ""Your uncle has gone fast today, so goodbye. I just have a saying to you: Your three sisters are all very good. In the future, you will be able to learn to learn needlework and thread, or laugh at me occasionally. But the most thing I am worried about is: I have a root of evil, and I am the ""demon king of the world"" in my family. Today, I went to the temple to fulfill my wish and have not come back yet. You will know that you will see it in the evening. You only ignore him in the future, and you sisters dare not mess with him."""
"Daiyu often heard her mother say that her second aunt had a cousin who was born to her, and she was a childish person. She was extremely naughty and hates studying and liked to hang out in the inner chamber. Her grandmother was also very spoiled and no one dared to care.Now that Mrs. Wang said this, I knew that she was talking about this cousin.He smiled and said, ""What my aunt said is the brother born to the jade? When I was at home, I heard my mother often say that this brother is one year older than me, and his nickname is Baoyu. Although he is very stubborn, he said that he is very good in sisterhood. Moreover, when I come, I will only be with my sisters. The brothers are from another courtyard, so how can they get involved?"" Mrs. Wang smiled and said, ""You don't know why: he is different from others. He has been loved by the old lady since childhood. He is originally from the original family.The sisters are used to being spoiled.If the sisters ignore him one day, he will be quieter. Even if he is bored, he will leave the second door and hold his two little children behind his back and vent his anger. It will be over in a while.If the sisters say something more to him on this day, he will be happy and he will have many things happening.So tell you not to pay attention to him.He is sweet and sweet, and he will be crazy and stupid.Don't trust him."""
"Daiyu agreed one by one.A maid went back and forth: ""The old lady is circulating dinner."" Mrs. Wang hurriedly took Daiyu from the back door from the back porch to the west, and out of the corner door, which was a wide road between north and south.To the south is three small halls with downward seats, and to the north is a large pink and oil screen wall, with half the door behind it, and a small room.Mrs. Wang smiled and pointed at Daiyu and said, ""This is your sister Feng's house. When you come back, you can come here to find him. If you don't have anything, just tell him."" There are four or five servants in the yard, all standing with their hands down.Mrs. Wang then took Daiyu through a hall, which was Jia Mu's backyard."
"So, when he entered the back door, many people were already serving him here. When he saw Mrs. Wang coming, he set up tables and chairs.Jia Zhu's wife Li held the rice, Xifeng put the chopsticks on her feet, and Mrs. Wang brought the soup.Jia Mu sat alone on the couch in front, with four empty chairs on both sides. Xifeng hurriedly pulled Daiyu to sit on the first chair on the left, and Daiyu was very reluctant.Jia Mu smiled and said, ""Your aunt and sister-in-law are not eating here. You are a guest, so that's how you should sit."" Daiyu said sheltered and sat down.Jia Mu ordered Mrs. Wang to sit down.The three sisters Yingchun and the other two sued the seat before coming up.Yingchun then sits first with the right hand, Tanchun sits second with the left, and Xichun sits second with the right.The maid next to her was holding a whisk, a rinse bowl, and a crust.Li and Feng stood beside the case and set up aside.Although there are many daughters-in-law and maids serving outside, they don’t even smell any coughs."
"After the meal, each maid brought the tea on a small tea plate.On that day, Lin Ruhai taught his daughter to cherish her blessings and nourish her body. After the meal, she waited for the rice to be swallowed and then ate tea for a while, so that she would not harm her spleen and stomach.Now Daiyu saw that many things here are not suitable for the family style, and she had to follow them, so she had to change them one by one, so she took the tea.I had seen someone holding the rinse bowl again, so Daiyu also rinsed her mouth.After washing my hands, I brought the tea again, and this recipe was the tea I ate.Jia Mu said, ""You go, let us talk freely."" After hearing this, Mrs. Wang stood up quickly and said a few more gossips, and just led Feng and Li to go.Jia Mu asked Daiyu what book she was studying.Daiyu said, ""I just read the Four Books."" Daiyu asked the sisters what book they read.Jia Mu said: ""What kind of book are you reading? You just recognize two words, you are not just blind people with open eyes!"""
"Before he could finish his sentence, he heard a sound of footsteps outside. The maid came in and said with a smile, ""Baoyu is here!"" Daiyu was wondering in her heart: ""I don't know how this Baoyu gave birth to a tired person, a ignorant naughty boy? - It's okay if I don't see that stupid guy."" Thinking in her heart, she suddenly saw that the maid had not finished speaking, a young young man had already come in:"
"He wore a purple gold crown with a tied hair on his head, and his eyebrows were tied with two dragons and his golden plasters; he wore a two-color golden butterfly with big red arrow sleeves, a colorful silk flower-collared flower-collared long-snatched palace belt, and a stone green flower-burning eight-piece Japanese satin row-snatched gown; he wore a small morning boots with green satin foundation.His face is like the Mid-Autumn Festival moon, his color is like the flowers in spring morning, his temples are like knife cuts, his eyebrows are like ink paintings, his face is like peach petals, and his eyes are like autumn waves.Even if you are angry and laugh, you will be angry and look at you.There is a golden dragon and a garland on the neck, and there is a five-color silk ribbon, which is tied with a piece of beautiful jade."
"When Daiyu saw it, she was shocked and thought to herself, ""It's so strange, it seems like she has seen it there, so familiar!"" When Baoyu asked Jia Mu for peace, Jia Mu ordered: ""Go to see your mother."" Baoyu turned around and went.When I came back, I looked back and saw that the crown belt had been changed: the short hair around the head was tied into small braids, the red silk ended, and the top middle hair was piled up, and a large braid was braided, which was as black as lacquer as lacquer. From the top to the tip, a string of four large beads were used with gold and eight treasures. I was wearing a silver-red flower-spreading half-old coat, and still had collars, jade, name locks, amulets and other items; the bottom was half-exposed pine flowers were sprinkled with flowers, trousers and legs, brocade edges, ink socks, and thick-soled big red shoes.The more I look like powder on my face and the lips are like grease; I look forward to it and I always smile in my words.A natural charm is all over the eyebrows; all kinds of emotions in my life are filled with the corners of my eyes.It is the best to look at its appearance, but it is difficult to know its background.Later generations had two poems, ""Xijiangyue"", which criticized Baoyu very well, and the poem said:"
"Looking for sorrow and hatred for no reason, sometimes it seems as stupid as crazy.Even if you have a good skin, it turns out that it is wild in your abdomen.He is incompetent and has no understanding of world affairs, and is stubborn and afraid to read articles.If you behave in a remote and eccentric manner, you will be slandered by the world!"
"Wealth and honor do not know how to be happy, and poverty cannot withstand desolation.Poor to let down the good times, there is no hope for the country and the family.The world is incompetent, and the ancient and modern times are unparalleled.I send a message to you and the rich man: Don’t use this shape!"
"Jia Mu smiled and said, ""I took off my clothes before I saw the guest. I won't go to see your sister!"" Baoyu had already seen another sister, so she must be Aunt Lin's daughter, so she hurriedly bowed.When the couple saw each other, they sat down. They looked carefully and described it as different from everyone:"
"Two bent eyebrows seem to be frowning but not frowning, and one pair of eyes seem to be crying but not crying and revealing.The state of mind brings sorrow to both faces, and the contempt of the whole body suffers from illness.Tears were lit and gasping for a slight breath.When you are quiet, it is like a beautiful flower shining on the water, and when you move, it is like a weak willow supporting the wind.If the heart is more than the stem, it will be better than the disease of Xizi."
"After seeing it, Baoyu smiled and said, ""I have seen this sister before."" Jia Mu smiled and said, ""But it's nonsense, how have you seen him?"" Baoyu smiled and said, ""Although I have never seen him, I look at him kindly. Even if I have an old acquaintance in my heart, I will only meet again today."" Jia Mu smiled and said, ""Better, better, if this is the case, we will be more harmonious."" Baoyu then walked up to Daiyu and sat down, looked at it carefully, and asked, ""Have you ever studied?"" Daiyu said, ""I haven't studied, I have only been studying for a year, so I have to recognize a few words."" Baoyu said, ""What are the two words of the name of my sister?"" Daiyu said, ""I have never studied, I have only been studying for a year, so I have to recognize some words."" Baoyu said, ""What are the two words of the name of my sister?"" Daiyu said, ""I have never studied, I have only been studying for a year.Baoyu asked about the word ""动"".Daiyu said, ""There is no word."" Baoyu smiled and said, ""I will give my sister a wonderful word, and the word ""Pinpin"" is extremely wonderful."" Tanchun asked where it came from.Baoyu said, ""The ""Comprehensive Study of Ancient and Modern People"" says, ""There is a stone name in the West, which can be used to paint the ink for the eyebrows."" Moreover, if Lin Meimei's eyebrows are frowned, wouldn't it be different if she uses these two words?"" Tanchun smiled and said, ""I'm afraid it's your fabrication again."" Baoyu said, ""Except for the Four Books, there are too many fabrications, but I can't make them?"" He asked Daiyu again, ""But there is also jade?"" Everyone didn't understand his words, so Daiyu thought that because he had jade, he asked me whether there was or not, and replied, ""I don't have that. I think that jade is a rare thing, how can everyone have it?"""
"When Baoyu heard this, he immediately started to get mad. He took off the jade and threw it away desperately, cursing: ""What a rare thing, even if you are not good at choosing a person, you will say ""spiritual"" or not! I don't want to do anything!"" Everyone was so scared that they rushed to pick up the jade.Jia Mu hugged Baoyu in a hurry and said, ""You are evil! You are angry, it's easy to beat and scold people, why bother to throw your life!"" Baoyu cried and said, ""There are no sisters at home, but I have them, but I say it's boring; now that there are no sisters like gods, there are not even one of them, but this is not a good thing."" Jia Mu hurriedly coaxed him, ""Your sister originally came from, because when your aunt died, she couldn't bear to leave your sister and couldn't get along, so she took his jade with her: one is the whole ceremony of burial, and the filial piety of your sister; the other is the spirit of your aunt, and you can also say that you have no such thing as to exaggeration. How can you compare him now? It's not easy to bring it with you carefully, and your mother knows it carefully."" As he said that, he picked it up to the maid and brought it with him.When Baoyu heard this, he thought it was reasonable and he would not have a different story."
"At this moment, the wet nurse came to ask Daiyu's house.Jia Mu said, ""Now move Baoyu out and use me to the warm cupboard in the suite, and temporarily put your Miss Lin in the green sauna. After the winter is over, I will clean up the house with them in the spring and make another place."" Baoyu said, ""Good ancestors, I'm on the bed outside the green sauna cabinet, why bother coming out to make trouble again and the ancestors must not be quiet."" Jia Mu thought for a while and said, ""It's fine."" Each person has a wet nurse and a maid to take care of, and the rest are listening at night outside.On the other hand, Xifeng ordered people to give a lotus-coloured flower tent and a few brocade quilts and satin mattresses."
"Daiyu only brought two people: one was the wet nurse Wang since childhood, and the other was a ten-year-old girl, who also accompanied her since childhood, and was named Xueyan.Seeing that Xueyan was very young and childish, Madam Wang was extremely old. She thought that Daiyu was not satisfied with her efforts, so she called a second-class girl beside her and Daiyu.In addition, as in the example of Yingchun, each person has four other tutors, and in addition to the two maids who are in charge of hairpins and bracelets and bathe, there are five or six maids who are cleaning the houses.At that moment, Madam Wang and Parrot accompanied Daiyu in the blue saut cabinet.Baoyu's wet nurse, Mama Li, and the maid named Xiren, were accompanied by a large bed outside."
"It turns out that Xiren is also the maid of Jia Mu, whose real name is Pearl.Because Jia Mu spoiled Baoyu, she was afraid that Baoyu's maid would not be loyal to the loyal person. She always liked the people's hearts and was very kind, and she was responsible for her duties, so she met Baoyu.Baoyu knew that his original surname was Hua, and he had seen an old man's poem ""Flower Qi Xiren"" in his poem, so he replied to the Ming Dynasty, Jia Mu, and changed her name to Xiren.Xiren is also a little confused: when serving Mrs. Jia, there was only one Jia in his eyes; now when serving Mrs. Baoyu, there was only one Baoyu in his eyes.Just because Baoyu is eccentric and always advises Baoyu to refuse to listen, he feels really sad."
"It was late, Baoyu and Madam Li had already slept. Seeing that Daiyu and Parrot were still not resting in peace inside, he took off his makeup and came in quietly, and asked with a smile: ""Why is the girl not resting in peace?"" Daiyu hurriedly asked: ""Sister, please sit down."" Xiren sat on the edge of the bed.The parrot smiled and said, ""Miss Lin is sad here, and shed tears and said, ""I just came here today, and I have caused your brother's crazy. If you break the jade, wouldn't it be because of my fault?' Therefore, I was sad. I finally persuaded me."" Xiren said, ""Miss, stop like this. I'm afraid there will be more strange jokes in the future! If you stop doing this, you will be sad, I'm afraid you won't be sad. Don't worry!"" Daiyu said, ""I remember what my sisters said. I don't know what the jade is from? There are still handwriting on it?"" Xiren said, ""Even the family doesn't know the origin, and there are ready-made eyes on it. I heard that it was taken out of his mouth when it fell into the grass. You will know when I took it to you."" Daiyu hurriedly said, ""Forget it, it's late at night, it's not too late to see it tomorrow."" Everyone said again and then they rested."
"The next day, I got up and left Jia Mu. Because I came to Mrs. Wang, when Mrs. Wang and Xifeng were reading letters from Jinling, Mrs. Wang's brother and sister-in-law sent two daughters-in-law to talk.Although Daiyu didn't know the whole story, Tanchun and others knew that they were talking about Xue Pan, the son and cousin of the Xue family's aunt who lived in Jinling City. They relied on their wealth and power to kill people. They are now under the Yingtianfu case.Now that my mother's uncle Wang Ziteng has received the information, he sent people from his family to tell him that he intends to enter the capital."
