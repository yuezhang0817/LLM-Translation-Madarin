Editorial: What Has China Done Right to Boost Its Global Favorability?
"According to a Morning Consult poll covering 41 countries cited by U.S. political news website Axios, China's global favorability has shown a steady upward trend over the past year, with an accelerated rise particularly after March this year. As of the end of May, China's global net favorability stood at 8.8, while the U.S. recorded -1.5. This marks the first time since the organization began tracking this data that China's global favorability has surpassed that of the United States. This is not an isolated case; multiple international surveys in recent years have pointed to the same trend—the world’s perception of China is becoming increasingly friendly and positive."
"The growing global goodwill stems from China's consistent role as a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order. These efforts and achievements have had a positive impact on the international community. China's development and progress not only benefit its own people but also make significant contributions to world peace and development. China's contribution to global economic growth remains around 30%, with its economic growth rate ranking among the highest of the world's major economies.

Over more than a decade, the Belt and Road Initiative has brought tangible changes to the lives of countless ordinary people. In Africa, hydroelectric power stations built with the participation of Chinese enterprises have illuminated countless households. In Southeast Asia, industrial parks supported by Chinese technology and investment have sprung up. These projects impose no political conditions and refrain from a ""lecturing"" approach, instead sincerely addressing partner countries' urgent aspirations for economic development and improved livelihoods. What the world perceives is China's inclusive and benevolent spirit, encapsulated in the belief that ""only when everyone develops together can there be true development."""
"From mediating the reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran to actively implementing the Paris Agreement, from facilitating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to promoting the expansion of the BRICS cooperation mechanism, China has demonstrated to the world the image of a responsible major country. This is underpinned by the guidance of advanced ideas and the support of pragmatic actions. Since their introduction, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative have garnered positive responses and support from over 100 countries and international and regional organizations, injecting valuable stability and positive energy into a world fraught with changes and turbulence. By actively contributing to global development assistance projects, promoting the political resolution of hotspot issues, and injecting new momentum into strengthening civilizational dialogue, China has accurately grasped the trends of the times, focused on the common well-being of all humanity, and reflected the shared aspirations of people across nations for peace and development, earning increasingly widespread global recognition."
"The growing affinity for China also reflects the world's recognition and respect for a nation that is confident, self-reliant, and committed to upholding justice while supporting the weak and promoting goodness. In the face of rising unilateralism and protectionism, China stands firmly on the right side of history, driving the development of an open global economy. Confronted with hegemony and power politics, China consistently upholds justice and fairness, steadfastly safeguarding the international order based on international law and promoting its evolution toward greater fairness and reasonableness.  

At the same time, a country’s positive image is also reflected in the continuous enhancement of its soft power. Today, China’s cultural creativity is engaging the world with unprecedented vitality. From *Genshin Impact* and *Black Myth: Wukong* to TikTok and ""Xiaohongshu,"" from the overseas popularity of micro-dramas and the DeepSeek whirlwind to trends like ""China Travel"" and ""Hyper Bros,"" these phenomena and products have broken through the information cocoons long woven by Western media. They reveal a real China—a nation rich in technological innovation, profound historical heritage, and a warm, open-hearted people."
"The world's goodwill also stems from China's open and inclusive mindset and its confidence in the future. China is well aware that openness brings progress, while isolation inevitably leads to backwardness. We continue to expand our visa-free ""circle of friends,"" shorten the negative list for foreign investment, and improve the business environment, enabling global enterprises to share in the dividends of China's development. According to a recent HSBC survey, among over 5,700 multinational companies across 13 global markets, China ranks as the top target market. China's innovative breakthroughs in high-end manufacturing, green energy, artificial intelligence, and other fields not only drive its own high-quality development but also contribute ""Chinese solutions"" to addressing shared global challenges through advanced technologies and high-quality services."
"China's rising global favorability is by no means accidental. It is the natural outcome of decades of persistent hard work and peaceful development, the inevitable resonance of upholding extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits while practicing true multilateralism, and the vivid portrayal of an era collectively painted by countless Chinese enterprises, cultural workers, and ordinary people through sincere cooperation, innovative products, and friendly smiles. This goodwill reflects recognition of China’s path, affirmation of its contributions, and serves as a living testament to the deepening and rooting of the vision of a shared future for humanity. It reminds us that the shaping of a major country’s image lies not in assertive rhetoric but in the subtle influence of practice, not in deliberately crafted personas but in the persistent pursuit of ""doing the right thing."" By steadfastly advancing along this path of win-win cooperation, openness, and inclusiveness, an image of China as trustworthy, amiable, and respectable will undoubtedly grow clearer and warmer in the hearts of people around the world."
