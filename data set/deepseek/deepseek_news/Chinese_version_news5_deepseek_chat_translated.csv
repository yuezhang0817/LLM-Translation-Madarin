Editorial: Washington should not be surprised by Beijing's tit-for-tat response
"What exactly has happened between China and the U.S.? Why has the already cooling trade friction ""reignited,"" and how far will both sides go in this ""tit-for-tat"" confrontation? These are questions that have drawn significant attention from the international community in recent days. Since the China-U.S. trade talks in Madrid, the U.S. has continued to introduce a series of new restrictive measures against China, attempting to coerce Beijing by escalating tariff threats and imposing various controls. After facing firm countermeasures from China, the U.S. hurriedly sought to ""de-escalate."" This roller-coaster-like fluctuation once again exposes the capricious and short-sighted nature of its trade policy, demonstrating that Washington has yet to fully learn its lesson and truly understand the right way for China and the U.S. to coexist."
"The sudden shift in the trade atmosphere between the two sides has caught many by surprise, yet it is hardly unexpected. The immediate trigger for this escalation in trade tensions was the U.S. side's failure to honor its words and its backtracking on commitments—a recurring pattern in Washington’s behavior. In an editorial, the South China Morning Post noted that the latest escalation in Sino-U.S. tensions could be compared to the tariff war initiated by the U.S. in April this year, describing it as ""a new round of tit-for-tat measures triggered by the U.S.’s new technology restrictions."" The article warned that while tariffs may not rise as sharply as before, the real damage lies in Beijing’s perception that Washington is no longer reliable and that its promises are increasingly difficult to trust. CNN also described this new round of friction between China and the U.S. as ""déjà vu,"" recalling how, after the two countries reached a consensus through talks in Geneva in June, the U.S. side dropped a series of ""bombshells,"" leading to a downturn in bilateral relations."
"During this period, Washington has sent out many seemingly contradictory signals. On one hand, it claims that China will ""suffer the most"" if it does not yield; on the other hand, it suggests that it ""hopes to cooperate with China"" and that ""much depends on how the Chinese behave."" It appears that the ""cooperation"" some American politicians hope to achieve is one where Washington gets to feast at the table for free, while China has to foot the bill—or even ""cut its own flesh""—allowing the U.S. to take whatever it wants and leaving China to clean up the mess. Today, the shock, surprise, and even anger felt by some American politicians in response to China's reasonable and lawful countermeasures stem, to some extent, from the shattering of this illusion by the reality that ""China is increasingly treating the U.S. as an equal."""
"The United States has overestimated the effectiveness of its leverage while underestimating China's capacity for countermeasures and strategic resolve. This miscalculation has led to severe real-world repercussions. Following renewed threats from the U.S. to significantly raise tariffs on Chinese goods, American stock and foreign exchange markets immediately fell, triggering global market panic and casting a shadow over the world economy. The U.S.'s arbitrary actions in areas such as shipping and export controls have not only severely infringed upon China's legitimate rights and interests but have also disrupted international trade and maritime order, undermining the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains. China's firm response is aimed not only at safeguarding its own lawful rights and interests but also at upholding international fairness and justice."
"Many have observed that this year, every round of coercion initiated by the United States against China has hit a solid wall, and unilateral bullying is bound to be met with China's firm and precise countermeasures. This back-and-forth has established a clear logic: whoever engages in unreasonable suppression must bear the corresponding consequences. As the South China Morning Post noted, Washington's unpredictability and habitual tactics do not work on China. Beijing's stance has been consistent—any negotiations must be based on mutual respect and trust. We certainly hope Washington will proactively and promptly correct its misguided actions. However, if it continues to employ tactics of extreme pressure, creating leverage out of thin air, and reneging on its commitments, it is destined to repeatedly experience the pain of hitting a solid wall. Washington should develop a highly clear expectation of the consequences of its actions."
"Over the past five months, the economic and trade teams of China and the United States have held four rounds of talks, reaching important consensus. These efforts have stabilized bilateral economic and trade relations and provided a sense of predictability to global markets. This process has fully demonstrated that, on the basis of mutual respect and equal consultation, China and the United States are capable of finding solutions to problems. Reflecting on the lessons learned over the past months, Washington should recognize the following points: First, the U.S. must respect China’s legitimate development interests, which naturally include industrial upgrading and technological advancement. Second, China’s progress does not necessarily come at the expense of U.S. interests. While the two countries compete in certain areas, the shared opportunities for cooperation far outweigh the differences. Third, China and the United States can certainly engage in consultations on issues of mutual concern, but the outcome must be mutually beneficial. There is no realistic scenario where the U.S. wins everything and China loses everything. Fourth, China does not yield to pressure or coercion. The so-called ""big stick"" wielded by Washington is nothing but a paper tiger to the Chinese people."
"China has repeatedly emphasized that there are no winners in a tariff war or a trade war, and that equality, respect, and mutual benefit are the only ways to properly resolve differences. China does not want a trade war, but it will never sit idly by and watch its legitimate rights and interests being harmed, nor will it allow international economic and trade rules and the multilateral trading system to be undermined. The sooner Washington returns to the right path of engaging with China, the more likely it is that China-U.S. economic and trade relations will warm up again."
