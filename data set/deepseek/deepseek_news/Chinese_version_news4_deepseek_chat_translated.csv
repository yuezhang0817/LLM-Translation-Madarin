"Editorial: From Xi'an to Astana, China-Central Asia Cooperation Steadily Advances"
"At the invitation of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev of the Republic of Kazakhstan, President Xi Jinping traveled to Astana, Kazakhstan, from June 16 to 18 to attend the Second China-Central Asia Summit. During the summit, President Xi and other Central Asian leaders exchanged views on the achievements in the development of the China-Central Asia mechanism, mutually beneficial cooperation within the framework, and international and regional hot-button issues, and charted the course for the growth of relations between China and the five Central Asian countries. This is the first time that the China-Central Asia Summit is held in a Central Asian country. It “will open a golden age of regional cooperation” and “become another milestone in the cooperation between China and Central Asian countries”. The high praise from Central Asian media fully demonstrates the sincere expectation of regional countries for the summit to advance the building of a China-Central Asia community with a shared future."
"China’s relations with Central Asian countries are deeply rooted in history, widely driven by practical needs, and firmly supported by public opinion. In May 2023, the first China-Central Asia Summit was held in Xi’an, marking the official launch of the China-Central Asia mechanism and ushering bilateral relations into a new stage. At the Xi’an Summit, President Xi Jinping laid out the “Four Principles” for building a China-Central Asia community with a shared future and put forward the “Eight Suggestions” on strengthening cooperation between China and Central Asian countries, charting the course and defining the path for the growth of China-Central Asia relations. From Xi’an to Astana, this cooperation axis stretching over 3,000 kilometers not only carries forward the profound friendship of the millennia-old Silk Road, but also provides much-needed stability to a turbulent and changing world, setting a fine example of solidarity and collaboration among Global South countries."
"China and Central Asian countries are fellow travelers on the path to modernization. Since President Xi Jinping first proposed the initiative to jointly build the Silk Road Economic Belt in Kazakhstan in September 2013, Central Asia has become one of the regions with the highest concentration of projects under the Belt and Road cooperation framework. The collaboration between the two sides is not only substantial in quantity but also high in quality. In the first five months of this year, China’s total import and export volume with the five Central Asian countries reached 286.42 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 10.4 percent, setting a new record for the same period in history. The Central Asia-China gas pipeline has delivered over 500 billion cubic meters of natural gas to China. The China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway, currently under construction, will provide Kyrgyzstan with its first access to the sea. The China-Europe Railway Express, which traverses Central Asia, has built bridges of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. Confucius Institutes and Luban Workshops have nurtured a large number of talents skilled in cross-cultural communication and emerging engineering technologies. This “mutual pursuit” between China and Central Asian countries is not merely a growth curve on data charts but also the curve of smiles on the faces of their people, giving the phrase “win-win cooperation” a tangible warmth."
"""In the face of global challenges such as unilateralism and protectionism, China and Central Asian countries are confidently demonstrating a model of mutual respect, sustainable development, and mutual benefit,"" Central Asian media accurately summarized the core value of cooperation between China and Central Asian countries. Over the more than 30 years since establishing diplomatic relations, China and Central Asian nations have consistently adhered to the principles of mutual respect, good-neighborliness, solidarity, and mutual benefit, setting an example for a new type of international relations. With the formation of a ""three-fold comprehensive coverage"" framework—full coverage of comprehensive strategic partnerships, full coverage of Belt and Road cooperation agreements, and full coverage of bilateral efforts to implement the vision of a community with a shared future for humanity—and as the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative take root and bear fruit here, the vitality nurtured by China's cooperation with Central Asian countries as good neighbors, safe neighbors, and prosperous neighbors is driving the region to become a hopeful land of mutual benefit, harmony, and shared prosperity."
"China and Central Asian countries are all members of the Global South, committed to practicing true multilateralism. Within multilateral frameworks such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia, China and Central Asian countries have maintained close cooperation. Together, they uphold multilateralism, firmly support each other on issues concerning their respective core interests, stand up for one another at critical moments to speak out for justice, safeguard each other’s legitimate rights and interests as well as strategic interests, advance the democratization of international relations, and contribute to the development of a more just and equitable international order."
"There is a Kazakh proverb that says, “Where there is unity, there is sure to be happiness.” As the leaders of the six countries meet again in Astana, the second China-Central Asia Summit is set to be a grand event that further builds consensus, deepens cooperation, and advances the building of an even closer China-Central Asia community with a shared future. As good neighbors, good partners, good friends, and good brothers, China and Central Asian countries will, with greater wisdom and sense of responsibility, elevate relations to a new level and make new and greater contributions to peace, stability and prosperity of the region and the world."
