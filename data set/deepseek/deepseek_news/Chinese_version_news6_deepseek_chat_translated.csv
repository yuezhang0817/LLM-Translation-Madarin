"Editorial: The World Has Never Been More Eager to Understand ""Why China"""
"On October 14, the second World Conference on China Studies opened in Shanghai. Under the theme of ""Historical China and Contemporary China from a Global Perspective,"" the conference brought together approximately 500 guests from more than 50 countries and regions to jointly explore China's history, present, and future. At a time when economic globalization faces headwinds and civilizational dialogue encounters challenges, the international community's attention on China is growing day by day. China's international influence, appeal, and shaping power are also continuously strengthening. The world has never been more eager to understand China."
"In 2023, President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the World Conference on China Studies - Shanghai Forum, stating that ""China studies is about both a historical China and a contemporary China."" This statement elucidates the profound significance of China studies and provides important guidance for promoting exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations and advancing the prosperity and development of global China studies. The conference featured a main forum and five parallel sub-forums, covering multiple key dimensions of China studies. These discussions academically bridged historical and contemporary China, reflecting a holistic vision of civilization and conveying to the world China's consciousness and efforts in constructing a subjective knowledge system in the new era."
"The global rise of China studies reflects profound changes in the world's need and approach to understanding China. Traditional Sinology primarily focused on historical China, with an emphasis on texts and ancient civilizations. In contrast, China studies expands its scope from ""historical China"" to ""contemporary China,"" shifting from a ""text-based China"" to a ""China in practice,"" and transforming from an ""external perspective of China"" to an ""internal perspective of China."" Behind this shift lies the historic transformation of China's relationship with the world. Today, China is not only a subject of academic research but also a pathway and methodology toward modernization. In an era of profound global realignment, China has become ""a country with magnetic appeal."" The rise of China studies marks a significant milestone in the world's rediscovery, understanding, and learning from China. This discovery and understanding are no longer confined to an ""Orientalist"" gaze but are grounded in civilizational dialogue and mutual learning on equal footing."
"Historically, any global power has needed to establish its own subject-centered discipline to guide its understanding of the external world. Looking back at world history, Western Europe, Russia, and the United States, among others, all developed their own knowledge systems and constructed their subjectivity during their rise in the modern era. For instance, American Studies began to develop during World War II and matured in the 1960s, marked by the emergence of modernization theory. With modernization theory as a hallmark, the United States acquired a theoretical framework for self-awareness and expression, and on this basis, constructed its own knowledge system."
"The civilizational subjectivity of China studies lies in the fact that China’s development experience cannot be simply summarized within existing Western theoretical frameworks. To truly understand China, one must deeply grasp the unique genes of Chinese civilization. Historian Arnold J. Toynbee once remarked that among the more than 20 civilizations that have emerged in human history over the past 6,000 years, only Chinese culture has continued uninterrupted to this day. President Xi Jinping profoundly elaborated on and summarized the five prominent features of Chinese civilization—continuity, innovation, unity, inclusiveness, and peacefulness. These interconnected traits are not only the key to understanding China but also the foundation for China’s self-confidence. The practice of the Chinese path to modernization demonstrates that modernization does not equal Westernization, and civilizational diversity is the fundamental form of human development. Only by breaking free from the constraints of a single narrative can we truly understand China’s constructive significance to the world from a pluralistic perspective."
"As a comprehensive discipline that transcends traditional Sinology and regional China studies, the core value of World China Studies lies in reconstructing the global cognitive framework for understanding China. This disciplinary expansion carries profound practical significance: within the knowledge production system dominated by Western-centrism, biased perceptions once led to severe misunderstandings—the enactment of the 19th-century Chinese Exclusion Act in the United States was directly linked to the dissemination of distorted knowledge about China. Today, through interdisciplinary approaches and a global perspective, World China Studies provides the international community with an objective framework for comprehending China, gradually dismantling the cognitive biases perpetuated by the old ""hegemony-knowledge"" structure."
"As a practice of dialogue among civilizations, the World Conference on China Studies is itself a vivid example of exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations. The continuous convening of the conference demonstrates China's determination to integrate into the world with a more open and confident attitude and to participate in the construction of the global knowledge system. At a critical crossroads in human development, the spirit of open and inclusive dialogue embodied by the conference is particularly valuable. Chinese modernization has created a new form of human civilization and is expanding the broad space for the development and progress of human civilization with this new form."
