Editorial: It is an international consensus that peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved through military force.
"On the 16th, the conflict between Israel and Iran entered its fourth day, with both sides escalating their confrontations in a cycle of ""tit-for-tat"" retaliation. The mutual attacks have not only resulted in casualties and damage to facilities but have also set a dangerous precedent by targeting nuclear and energy installations, raising deep concerns in the international community about the situation spiraling out of control."
"Both Israel and Iran are significant countries in the Middle East, and the relationship between them affects the overall dynamics of war and peace in the region. The immediate priority is to take measures to prevent the escalation of conflict, avoid greater regional instability, and return to resolving issues through diplomatic means. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has held separate phone calls with his Iranian and Israeli counterparts, urging both sides to resolve their differences through dialogue. Relevant parties should take immediate action to put the brakes on escalation and de-escalate tensions. Countries such as Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom have also expressed their willingness to mediate. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres wrote on social media, ""The Israeli bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities and the Iranian missile strikes on Tel Aviv—enough is enough. It is time to stop. Peace and diplomacy must prevail."""
"It is crucial to fully recognize that only by upholding the concept of common security can the legitimate concerns of all parties be thoroughly addressed. Why are maximum pressure and preemptive actions not viable? The tortuous course of the Iranian nuclear issue itself proves this point. Superficially, the conflict stems from the ""nuclear"" issue, but in essence, it is yet another manifestation of the security dilemma. Israel, fearing that Iran's nuclear development would threaten its security, adopted a ""preemptive"" strategy. However, its infringement upon Iran's sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity has, in turn, plunged it into greater insecurity. In fact, the moment when the Iranian nuclear issue came closest to resolution was not achieved through ""preemptive"" strikes. Instead, it was in 2015, after 13 years of ""marathon"" negotiations and the strongest concerted mediation efforts by the international community, when a binding comprehensive agreement was reached. Had the U.S. not later reneged on the agreement, and had the agreement been seriously and fully implemented, both Iran and Israel would clearly be much safer than they are today."
"The ancient Roman scholar Cicero once noted, ""Most people believe that what is gained through war is more valuable than what is obtained in times of peace, but this is mistaken."" The late former Israeli President Shimon Peres expressed a similar view: ""The true victory is achieving peace, not sowing the seeds of another war."" Throughout history, the recurring military conflicts in the Middle East have not only failed to resolve disputes but have also laid the groundwork for further confrontations. The vicious cycle of violence and confrontation has deepened the rifts among regional nations, making the path to peaceful resolution increasingly difficult. For the Middle East to break free from the plight of bloodshed and turmoil, the primary step must be to abandon the outdated zero-sum mindset and advocate for a new vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security. It is important to recognize that, despite differing positions and principles, there are shared interests in Middle Eastern security affairs. Only through dialogue, rather than confrontation, can differences and opposition be narrowed, and the greatest common ground for cooperation be found."
"As a country with special influence over Israel, the US should especially bear due responsibility as a major country in its words and deeds. For a long time, the general impression has been that it is difficult for the US to play a constructive role in easing regional conflicts, but it is first-class in sabotage. The raging flames of war in the Middle East are also related to the ""visible hand"" of major countries outside the region. Many analysts believe that the US' attempt to force Iran into submission by means of ""maximum pressure"" is an important reason for the sudden escalation of the Iran-Israel situation. In an editorial, Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao said that Washington gave Iran 60 days to reach a nuclear negotiation, and Israel launched an attack exactly on the 61st day, ""showing the diplomatic tacit understanding of the two sides playing good cop and bad cop."" Last year, an article in The New York Times compared the US to a lion, the ""king of the jungle in the Middle East,"" and Iran to a ""parasitic wasp,"" advocating that in order to ""kill the parasitic wasp,"" the US needs to ""burn the entire jungle."" This kind of thinking is extremely dangerous."
"The security concerns of all countries in the Middle East must be addressed. It is a general consensus of the international community, including China, that the use of force will not bring peace to the Middle East. Diplomatic means to address the Iranian nuclear issue are not exhausted, and there is still hope for a peaceful settlement. The most important thing is for the conflicting parties and other relevant parties to take immediate measures to create conditions for returning to the right track of dialogue and negotiation for dispute settlement."
