"Feng Su, hearing the summons, had hurried out with a smile to ask what they wanted. “Fetch Mr. Zhen at once,” they bellowed.

“My name is Feng, not Zhen,” he replied with an ingratiating smile. “My son-in-law’s name is Zhen, but he left home to become a Taoist priest a couple of years ago. Is it him you want, I wonder?”

“How do we know whether it’s him or not?” they roared. “We’re here on the magistrate’s orders, so since he’s your son-in-law you’d better come along to answer for him.”

They would not let him say any more, but marched him off. The whole household was panic-stricken, not knowing what this meant."
"That evening, about the second watch, Feng Su came home in high glee. They all asked what had happened.

“It so happens,” he told them, “that our new prefect, Jia Hua, is a native of Huzhou. He used to be a friend of my son-in-law’s. As he was passing our door today and saw Chiao-hsing buying thread, he thought my son-in-law had moved here. When I explained the whole business to him, the prefect seemed very upset. He asked after my granddaughter, and I told him she was lost during the Lantern Festival. ‘Never mind,’ he said, ‘I shall send men to find her without fail.’ We talked for a while and when he left he made me a present of two taels of silver.”

This news reduced Chen Shih-yin’s wife to tears, but nothing more happened that night."
"The next day, Yucun sent two packets of silver and four rolls of brocade as a token of thanks to Mrs. Zhen, and also enclosed a confidential letter for Feng Su, asking him to request on his behalf the hand of Jiaoxing to be his second wife.

Feng Su was overjoyed and could not wait to do this favour. He prevailed on his daughter to agree and that very evening saw Jiaoxing carried by a small sedan-chair to Yucun’s quarters.

Yucun’s gratification need not be described. He gave Feng Su a hundred ounces of gold and sent numerous other gifts to his mother-in-law, urging her to take good care of her health while waiting to find out what had become of her daughter.

Feng Su went home well satisfied."
"Now the maid Jiaoxing was the one who had looked back at Yucun that year. That single glance had led to this, a strange instance of karma which she could never have anticipated. As luck would have it, she came to his side, and within a year she had borne a son; moreover, after another six months Yucun’s wife contracted an illness and died, and he installed Jiaoxing as his principal wife. Truly:"
"By a single accidental slip, one may rise above the common herd."
"It appears that after Yu-tsun had taken his leave of Shih-yin, he started on the sixteenth for the capital. When the day of the examination came, he was, contrary to all expectation, so successful that he passed his doctorate, and was selected a member of the Imperial College. Without a moment’s delay he was chosen for a provincial post, and in due course he was promoted to the prefectship of this district. But, although his abilities were sterling, his conduct was at the same time overbearing and harsh. In addition, he looked down upon his superiors, with the result that these officials all turned a hostile eye upon him. In less than a year, they discovered some weak point in his antecedents, and so, laying a memorial before the Throne, they represented that as he was of a haughty disposition, he had, on the strength of the influence of his former reputation, insulted his colleagues; that he had, with bootless zeal, recklessly introduced innovations; and that, while he made a pretence of probity and uprightness, he had secretly given himself over to evil deeds, with the consequence that the inhabitants of the district found their lot unbearable. The Dragon countenance was considerably incensed. His Majesty lost no time in issuing commands that he should be deprived of his official status. When the despatch from the Board reached the prefecture, the whole staff experienced much gratification. Yu-tsun, at first, gave way to feelings of shame and resentment; but as he had, at this time, no money in his possession, and no place to go to, he found himself, in fact, in a state of destitution. It was only after he had been in this plight for some time, that he at length discovered the necessity of contriving some plan for his wants. Having, by chance, come to take up his quarters in the Hu K’ou monastery, he unexpectedly met a strange man in the temple, who, on account of poverty, had likewise nowhere to go. He recognised in him a certain Chang Ju-k’uei, a native of this place. This Chang Ju-k’uei had been a gentleman in easy circumstances, but had subsequently become poor and destitute. He had, at home, neither land nor house, and was therefore compelled to live with his wife and family in the temple. As he, for his living, occupied himself, in an amateur way, with teaching a few pupils, he thus managed to make ends meet. When Yu-tsun came across him, his frame of mind was at the time, in every respect, dull and apathetic; and as he had moreover a considerable amount of time on his hands, he availed himself of the occasion to constantly associate with him, drinking his wine to while time away. In no long while, the year drew near its close."
"One day, on a visit to Weiyang, I heard that this year the Salt Commissioner was Lin Ru-hai. His name was Lin Hai, his courtesy name Ru-hai. He had come third in a previous Imperial examination and had now risen to the rank of Censor in the Censorate. He was a native of Gusu and had been recently summoned to the capital where he had been a Grain Commissioner for just over a month. His forebears had held hereditary ranks, and he was the fifth in his family to inherit the title marquis. The original grant had been for three generations only, but such was the present emperor’s magnanimity that he had extended it for another generation. Now Lin Ru-hai had won success in the examinations. Although his family was influential and wealthy, he was a scholar like his forefathers. Unfortunately, like many other branches of the Lin family, his had not prospered. Although several lines existed, Lin Ru-hai had no close blood relations. He was now forty and had just one son, but the boy had died the previous year at the age of three. Although he had several concubines, it seemed fated that he should have no son, and he could do nothing about it. His principal wife, née Jia, had given him a daughter Dai-yu, just five years old. Both parents doted on her. Seeing that she was as intelligent as she was pretty, they decided to give her a good education to make up for their lack of a son and help them forget their loss."
"Yucun happened to catch a chill, and while he was convalescing in an inn, it took him a month to get well. He was short of funds and, being also disinclined to face the long journey in his run-down condition, he decided to look for some temporary lodging where he could recuperate. Luckily he had two friends here who kept him in their villa. Hearing that the Salt Commissioner was looking for a tutor, Yucun grasped this opportunity and asked his friends to put in a word for him. His idea was to stay there until he had fully recovered.

His hopes were fulfilled. The work proved undemanding, since his pupil was a young girl and attended only by two maids. Delicate in health, she applied herself to her studies only as much as she felt inclined."
"Another year slipped by, and then the mother of his pupil suddenly fell ill and died. While she was mourning for her mother with such zeal that she fell ill herself and had to give up her lessons. Jia Yucun stayed at home, and having plenty of time went out for a walk after lunch when the weather was fine."
"One day I made an excursion outside the city to enjoy the countryside landscape. Coming without design to a place where hills and streams meandered, woods and bamboos luxuriated, I caught sight of a temple almost hidden in a thick grove. The entrance was in ruins, the walls were crumbling. Over the gate was a horizontal board with the inscription: Wisdom Attained Temple. And flanking the gate were two old, cracked vertical scrolls bearing the couplet:"
"With plenty behind, one forgets to close his hands;  
With no way out ahead, he yearns to turn around."
"After reading the inscription, Yucun thought to himself, ""These two lines, though simple in language, carry a profound meaning. I have visited many famous mountains and great monasteries, but I have never come across such a saying. It must be that someone who has experienced a great awakening resides here; perhaps I should go in and explore."" With this thought, he stepped inside and saw only a frail, elderly monk cooking porridge. Yucun paid him little attention. But when he asked the old monk a few questions, he found him to be both deaf and nearly blind, his teeth gone and his speech slurred, so his answers were completely irrelevant to the questions."
"Yu-tsun was feeling thoroughly bored and decided to go back to the village inn to fetch some wine to drink, hoping to dispel his melancholy. He started to stroll towards it, and just as he was entering the inn, a fellow who had been drinking there rose to his feet and came forward to greet him, laughing heartily and exclaiming, ""Well met! Well met!"" Yu-tsun hastened to return his greeting and, looking more closely, saw that it was an old acquaintance from the capital, a dealer in antiques known as Leng Tzu-hsing. Yu-tsun had always admired him as a man of ability and enterprise, while Tzu-hsing for his part was charmed with Yu-tsun's reputation as a scholar, so that the two of them had always got on very well together."
"Yu-tsun smilingly hastened to ask: ""When did you arrive, brother? I wasn't at all aware of your visit. What a fortunate coincidence meeting you today!""

""I reached home at the end of last year,"" replied Tzu-hsing. ""I'm on my way now to the capital to see to some business and break my journey here to call on a friend. He was good enough to insist on putting me up for a couple of days, and as I've no pressing business I decided to stay on till the middle of the month before continuing my journey. My friend is engaged today, so I came out for a stroll and stopped here to rest. I'd no idea I'd run into you like this.""

He invited Yu-tsun to share his table, called for more wine and dishes, and over their wine they chatted about all that had happened since their separation."
"Yucun asked, ""Is there any news from the capital?"" Zixing replied, ""None, except for a curious little incident involving a member of your honorable clan."" Yucun smiled, ""There is no one from my clan in the capital. What makes you say that?"" Zixing responded with a smile, ""People who share the same surname must belong to the same clan, mustn't they?"" Yucun inquired which family he meant. Zixing said, ""The Jia family of the Rongguo Mansion. Wouldn’t that bring disgrace to your honorable name?"" Yucun chuckled, ""So it’s them. If we’re speaking of lineage, my humble clan is indeed large. Since Jia Fu of the Eastern Han Dynasty, our branches have flourished and spread across every province—who could possibly trace them all? As for the Rongguo branch, we are indeed recorded in the same genealogy. But with their current glory, it would be presumptuous for us to claim kinship, and over time, the connection has grown distant and hard to verify."""
"Zixing sighed, ""Don't say that, sir. Why, the Ning and Rong mansions aren't what they were in the old days.""

Yucun asked, ""Surely they are still flourishing? When I passed them last year I saw, on the east and west sides of the street, two large mansions opposite each other. The surrounding walls were in good repair and through the gateway I had a glimpse of most imposing halls and pavilions, while the gardens, which had been extended, were full of trees and rockeries.""

""Ah, you are a Palace Graduate,"" said Zixing with a smile. ""But don't you know the saying: 'A centipede dies but never falls down'? Although they are not as prosperous as before, compared with ordinary official families they are still far better off. Their households are increasing and their commitments are growing, while masters and servants alike are so used to lording it in luxury that not one of them thinks ahead. They squander money every day and are quite unable to economize. Outwardly they may look as grand as ever, but their purses are nearly empty. That's not their most serious trouble, though. Would you believe it, in these highly cultured and scholarly households of theirs the sons of the house are each one worse than the last.""

Yucun was amazed. ""Highly cultured and scholarly families always know how to educate their sons,"" he demurred. ""Other households may be mismanaged, but I can't believe that of the Jins."""
"Zixing sighed, “Just so. I’ll tell you. The Duke of Ningguo and the Duke of Rongguo were brothers by the same mother. The Duke of Ningguo, the elder, had four sons. When he died, the eldest of these, Jia Daihua, inherited his title. He had two sons. The elder, Jia Fu, died when he was eight or nine, so the second son, Jia Jing, inherited the title. All he cares about is Taoism and distilling elixirs. Luckily, he had a son in his early years called Jia Zhen to whom he relinquished the title because he wanted to become an immortal. Instead of going back to his native place, he has stayed outside the capital fooling about with Taoist priests.

“This Jia Zhen has a son named Jia Rong, just sixteen. And Jia Jing washes his hands of all mundane matters, while Jia Zhen has never studied but lives for pleasure only, turning the Ning Mansion upside down by his goings-on. Yet nobody dares restrain him.

“Now for the Rong Mansion. The strange business I just mentioned happened there. After the death of the Duke of Rongguo, his elder son Jia Daishan inherited the title and married the daughter of the Marquis of Jinling, a maiden from the Shi family. Two sons were born to them, Jia She and Jia Zheng. Jia Daishan is dead now, but the old lady is still alive. His elder son Jia She inherited the title. The younger, Jia Zheng, has loved study from his earliest years and was his grandfather’s favourite. He was destined to take the official examinations, but when Jia Daishan died he willed that the Emperor should be petitioned to allow Jia Zheng to inherit an office in recognition of his father’s services. The Emperor, in his graciousness, not only granted this request but after an audience appointed Jia Zheng an assistant secretary in the Board of Works, and now he has been promoted to the rank of under-secretary.

“His wife, Lady Wang, first bore him a son called Jia Zhu, who passed the district examination at fourteen, married before he was twenty and died of illness after fathering a son. Her second child was a daughter, born oddly enough on the first day of the year. But stranger still, the next year she bore a son who came into the world with a piece of clear, brilliantly coloured jade in his mouth. It’s covered with inscriptions too. Isn’t that remarkable?”"
"Yucun smiled. ""This child certainly seems unusual. I shouldn't be surprised if he turned out to be a person of some importance.""

Zixing sniffed. ""That's what everyone says. And because of it his grandmother has always tended to spoil him. When he was just one year old and his father tested his disposition by putting a lot of objects down in front of him for him to choose from, he reached out for the women's things — the cosmetics and trinkets and so forth. His father was absolutely furious and said he'd grow up to be a rake. He's hated him ever since. But the old lady still dotes on him as if he were her own precious jewel.

""And the strangest thing is that now he's seven or eight and old enough to have a tutor, the boy's already a brilliant scholar, though a bit of a scamp. But you'll never guess what he says. He says:

""The girls are made of water and the boys are made of mud. When I am with girls I feel fresh and clean, but when I am with boys I feel stupid and nasty.""

Don't you call that ridiculous? He's bound to grow up into a lecher.""

Yucun's face assumed an expression of unwonted severity. ""No! You are mistaken. I'm afraid you don't understand. This child is no ordinary lecher. In judging him so, your politician friend has made a big mistake. You have to have studied a good deal and gained a deep insight into the nature of things before you can begin to understand a person like him."""
"Zixing, impressed by his weighty remarks, asked him to expound.

Yucun replied, “Heaven has endowed men from the time of birth with natures which, apart from the very good and the very bad, are much alike. If the world is well governed, men of great goodness are born; if ill governed, men of great evil. Of the former kind were Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Kings Wen and Wu, the Duke of Zhou, the Duke of Shao, Confucius, Mencius, Dong Zhongshu, Han Yu, Zhou Dunyi, the Cheng brothers, Zhang Zai and Zhu Xi. Of the latter were Chi You, Gong Gong, Jie, Zhou, the First Emperor of Qin, Wang Mang, Cao Cao, Huan Wen, An Lushan and Qin Kuai.

“The good govern the world, the evil throw it into confusion. The good are filled with a spirit of benevolence and justice, the quintessence of the benign forces of nature; the evil, with a spirit of perversity, the quintessence of its evil forces. And since the present world is well governed, men are imbued with benevolence and justice from the highest to the lowest, so much so that this benign spirit overflowing on all sides has produced sweet dew and gentle breezes which bathe the whole world.

“The evil spirit, unable to expand under the brilliant sunlight, congeals and fills the deep ravines. And if by some chance this spirit is stirred and a few wisps escape, meeting the benign spirit, the good refuses to yield to the evil, just as the evil envies the good, until neither prevails and they cancel out. Then, just as wind, rain, lightning and thunder cannot but discharge their fury when they meet, so this spirit, when it enters men, makes them neither wholly good nor wholly bad but exceptional. Born into rich or noble families, such men will become great lovers; born into poor but cultured families, they will become high-minded scholars or recluses. Even if born into poor humble families, they will never grow up into yamen runners or servants content to be at everyone’s beck and call — they will become famous actors or singers. Such men in the past were Xu Yu, Tao Qian, Ruan Ji, Ji Kang, Liu Ling, the Wang and Xie families, Gu Kaizhi, Chen Shubao, Emperor Ming of the Tang Dynasty, Emperor Huizong of Song, Liu Tingzhi, Wen Tingyun, Mi Fu, Shi Yannian, Liu Yong and Qin Guan. More recent examples are Ni Zan, Tang Yin and Zhu Yunming. Others like Li Guinian, Huang Fanchuo, Jing Xinmo, Zhuo Wenjun, Hongfo, Xue Tao, Cui Yingying and Zhaoyun are also of the same type, however different their circumstances.”"
"Zixing remarked, ""According to you, success makes a prince, failure a outlaw.""

""Exactly,"" said Yucun. ""But I may as well tell you that since my dismissal I've spent the last two years travelling through different provinces and come across one or two remarkable children. That's why I guessed what you were driving at when you mentioned Baoyu just now. But to come to the Zhen family of Nanking. You know, don't you, that they live near the Imperial Palace and are superintendents of the Court of Imperial Entertainments?""

""Of course,"" said Zixing. ""Everyone knows that the Zhens are old friends as well as relatives by marriage of the Jias. In fact, they're on very close terms. I've been to their house a number of times myself."""
"Yucun smiled and said, ""Last year when I was in Jinling, someone recommended me to the Zhen family as a tutor. I went to have a look, and found that despite their nobility and wealth, they were a family who prized politeness, a rare thing. But though my pupil was only a beginner, he gave me more trouble than a candidate for the provincial examinations. And the most ridiculous thing was that he said, 'I must have two girls as classmates to be able to learn and remember. Otherwise I can't take anything in.' He often told his pages, 'The word ""girl"" is so honourable and pure, not even the names of Buddha or the Supreme Deity are as exalted. You mustn't defile it with your foul breath and stinking tongues. If you want to refer to girls, first rinse your mouths out with clean water and fragrant tea. If you don't, your teeth should be knocked out and your jaws gashed.' He was so wild and stubborn, and so stupid, yet after class, when he went inside to see the girls, he was completely different — gentle, sweet, clever and well-behaved. His father gave him several severe beatings, but it did no good. When the pain was more than he could bear, he would start yelling 'Sisters!' The girls in the inner chambers teased him, asking,Why do you call to us when you're being beaten? Do you want us to beg you off? You ought to be ashamed.' His answer was that once when he was in great pain, calling out 'dear sisters' had somehow eased it. So after that, whenever it hurt too much, he kept calling out 'sisters.' Wasn't that absurd? Because his grandmother doted on him, she used to blame her grandson's tutor and her son for his troubles. That's why I resigned. Now I'm tutoring Commissioner Lin's daughter. A boy like that is bound to let down his ancestors and ignore his tutor's advice. It's a pity, though, for all those girls in his family are exceptional."""
"Zixing said, ""The Jia family has three good daughters. Jia Zheng’s eldest daughter, Yuanchun, was chosen on account of her intelligence and virtue to be an Imperial Lady-in-Waiting. The second daughter, Yingchun, is the child of Sir She by a concubine. Tanchun, the third daughter, is Jia Zheng’s child by a concubine; and Xichun, the fourth, is the sister of Jia Zhen of the Ning Mansion. Because the Lady Dowager dotes on her granddaughters, they all study in the Rong Mansion, and I’ve heard they’re doing well.""

Yucun observed, ""The Zhen family was remarkable in giving their daughters names like those of boys instead of choosing flowery names like ‘spring,’ ‘red,’ ‘fragrance,’ or ‘jade.’ How is it the Jias have followed this common practice?""

""Not so,"" replied Zixing. ""The eldest daughter was born on New Year’s day, and so given the name Yuanchun. The others have ‘spring’ in their names too. But the generation before them used names like those of boys. Here is the evidence: your worthy employer’s wife, the sister of Jia She and Jia Zheng in the Rong Mansion, was called Jia Min before she married. If you don’t believe me, make inquiries when you go back.""

Yucun smacked the table and laughed. ""No wonder my pupil always pronounces min as mi and writes the character with one or two strokes missing. That puzzled me, but now you’ve explained the reason. No wonder she talks and behaves differently from other girls. I suspected she must have had an unusual mother. It’s not surprising, now that I know she is the granddaughter of the Rong family. What a pity that her mother died last month.""

Zixing sighed. ""She was the youngest of four sisters, but now she’s gone. Not one of that older generation is left. We shall have to see what husbands the younger generation get."""
"Yucun said, ""Exactly. I was just going to ask about him. So Lord Zheng has a son born with a jade and a grandson by his first son, but Lord She hasn't a single son?""

""If Lord Zheng had his son with the jade, his concubine later bore him another son, but I can't say whether he's any good or not. At present he has two sons and a grandson, though it's hard to tell how they'll turn out. Lord She has two sons. The elder, Jia Lian, is now about twenty. He married a niece of Lady Wang, the wife of his uncle Zheng, so it was a marriage between cousins. He's been married for two years and has purchased the rank of a sub-prefect. He's no scholar, but he's a man of the world, a smooth talker who spends his time at home just now helping his uncle to manage domestic affairs. Since his marriage, though, his wife has stolen all his thunder. She's such a dazzling beauty and so quick-tongued, she's a match for any man. As for subtlety — in that she leaves all the men standing."""
"Yu-tsun smiled. ""This proves that what I said a moment ago was not wrong. It seems quite possible that all the people we've just mentioned were produced by a mixture of good and evil elements in conflict.""

""Never mind whether they were good or bad,"" said Tzu-hsing. ""Just stop calculating about other people and have a cup of wine.""

""Quite right,"" said Yu-tsun. ""Talking so much has made me careless about drinking.""

""There's nothing like gossip to go with wine."" Tzu-hsing chuckled. ""What does it matter if we drink a few cups more?""

Yu-tsun looked out of the window.

""It's late,"" he remarked. ""We must be careful not to get shut out. Why not stroll back to town now and continue our conversation there?""

They rose and paid the bill. They were on the point of leaving when a man who had just entered the tavern accosted Yu-tsun, crying:

""I am glad to see you, brother! I've good news for you.""

Yu-tsun turned to see who it was."
