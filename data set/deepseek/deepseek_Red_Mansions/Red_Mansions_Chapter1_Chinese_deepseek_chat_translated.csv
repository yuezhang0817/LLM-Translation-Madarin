"This is the opening chapter of the novel. The author, having experienced a dreamlike life himself, concealed the true events and resorted to allegory to narrate the story of the *Record of the Stone*. Hence the name ""Zhen Shiyin"" (Homophone for ""true facts concealed""). But what, you may ask, is the book about? The author continues:

""Now, having led a life of hardship and accomplished nothing, I suddenly recalled all the girls I had known in my past. Reflecting on them one by one, it struck me that in conduct and understanding they were all superior to me. Why am I, with my masculine dignity, inferior even to women? Overwhelmed with shame, I repented—yet to no avail, for this was truly a hopeless predicament! At this point, I resolved to compile my experiences into a book to confess to the world. Though my faults cannot be excused, the stories of these women in the inner chambers must not be lost or obscured on my account, nor should they be buried with my own shortcomings and failings.

""Though today my dwelling is but a thatched hut with matted windows, earthen stove, and rope-strung bed, the morning breeze, evening dew, willows by the steps, and flowers in the courtyard do nothing to hinder the flow of my thoughts and ink. Unscholarly as I am, and lacking refinement in my writing, what does it matter if I tell a tale in rustic language to spin a story? It may serve to celebrate these women and bring some diversion to others, dispelling their gloom. Is that not a worthy endeavor?"" Hence the name ""Jia Yucun"" (Homophone for ""fiction in rustic words"")."
"In this chapter, the use of terms such as ""dream"" and ""illusion"" serves to alert the reader to the underlying theme and the fundamental purpose of this book."
"Gentle reader,
What, you may ask, was the origin of this book?
Although the answer to this question may at first seem to border on the absurd, reflection will show that there is a good deal more in it than meets the eye.
Let me explain without further ado."
"Long ago, when the goddess Nü Wa was repairing the sky, she melted down a great quantity of rock at the foot of the Blue Ridge Peak in the boundless mountains of the Great Waste. This was the foundation of her work. She fashioned thirty-six thousand five hundred and one blocks of stone, each measuring seventy-two feet by a hundred and forty-four feet square. She used only thirty-six thousand five hundred of these blocks in the course of her labors and discarded the single remaining stone at the foot of the Blue Ridge Peak. This stone, having undergone the melting and molding of a goddess, possessed magic powers. It could move about at will and could grow or shrink to any size it wanted. Observing that all the other blocks had been used for celestial repairs and that it was the only one to have been rejected as unworthy, the stone became filled with shame and resentment and passed its days in sorrow and lamentation."
"One day, in the midst of his lamentings, he saw approaching from the distance a Buddhist monk and a Taoist priest, both of striking demeanour and distinguished appearance. They came up to the foot of Greensickness Peak and sat down on a rock to chat.

At first they spoke of the clouds and the mist on the top of the mountain, then of the supernatural and arcane on the sea floor. But presently their conversation turned to the subject of worldly glory and riches. The stone overhearing them felt a powerful craving stir in its heart, and could not help addressing them in human speech.

'Venerable masters!' it said (having first uttered the sort of polite phrases which propriety demands). 'Just now I overheard you speaking of the glory and splendour of the world of men. I am sure that you must have great powers of supernatural insight. Will you not take me with you and allow me to have a little foretaste of these delights? My body may be uncouth, but my spiritual part is, I believe, perceptive; and though my understanding may be dull, I feel that I have an instinct for the truth. If you will take me with you into the world of men and let me remain there for a few years, I will promise to be forever thankful for your kindness.'

The monk and the priest looked at each other. The priest smiled.

'It sounds a reasonable enough request,' he said. 'But be warned! The world of men has pleasures, but they cannot be relied on. ""When one thing is perfect, another is sure to be imperfect."" And in the end, ""all good things must come to an end."" It would be better not to go.'"
"This stone, its mortal heart now ablaze, could not bear to listen to such talk and pleaded with them again and again. The two immortals, realizing they could not force it, sighed and said, ""This is the fate of stillness giving way to motion, of something arising from nothing. Very well, then, we shall take you to enjoy the pleasures of this world. But remember, when you find yourself unsatisfied, do not regret it."" The stone replied, ""Of course, of course."" The monk added, ""Though you possess spiritual awareness, you are still coarse and unrefined, with nothing extraordinary about you. You are only fit to serve as a stepping stone. So be it—I shall now employ the great power of the Dharma to assist you. When your trials are over, you shall return to your original form, and this matter will be concluded. What do you say?"" The stone, hearing this, was overwhelmed with gratitude.

The monk then chanted incantations, drew talismans, and performed a great illusory art, transforming the large stone in an instant into a radiant, lustrous piece of jade, reduced to the size of a fan pendant, small enough to be worn or held. Holding it in his palm, the monk laughed and said, ""Your form is now that of a treasure! Yet it still lacks any real virtue. We must inscribe a few characters on it, so that at a glance people will recognize it as something extraordinary. Then we shall take you to a prosperous and flourishing land, a family of cultured nobility, a place of blooming flowers and swaying willows, a realm of luxury and refinement, where you may settle and find contentment."" The stone, overjoyed, asked, ""What extraordinary qualities have you bestowed upon me? And where exactly will you take me? I beg you to make it clear, so that I may not remain in doubt."" The monk smiled and said, ""Do not ask now. In time, all will become clear."" With these words, he tucked the stone into his sleeve and departed gracefully with the Taoist, no one knowing where they went or where they would stay."
"Later, after an unknown number of cycles and calamities, a Taoist known as Reverend Void, in his quest for enlightenment and immortality, happened to pass by the foot of the Great Fable Mountain in the Land of Illusion, below the Nonesuch Bluff by the Bank of Infatuation. There, he suddenly noticed a large stone slab inscribed with clearly legible characters that recounted a detailed story. Reverend Void read it from the beginning and discovered that it told of a stone that had been found unfit to repair the heavens, had transformed and descended into the mortal world. It had been led through the joys and sorrows of human existence, the warmth and coldness of worldly affairs, by the Buddhist Mahasattva Impervioso and the Taoist illuminate Mysterioso. At the end of the narrative, there was a verse that read:"
"Vainly I repaired the azure sky,  
For many a year in the world of men was I.  
Events of this life and the lives before  
What tale will transmit them to the world once more?"
"Following the verse is the tale of the stone’s descent into the world, its incarnation, and the various experiences it went through. It contains a full record of the trivial affairs of the inner chambers as well as mirthful verses and idle poems; but the exact dates, geographical situation, and dynastic period are unverifiable."
"So the Taoist of Infinite Space addressed the Stone as follows:  
""Brother Stone, according to your own tale, your story contains matter of sufficient interest to merit publication. But as far as I can see, there is no means of dating it; and, what is more, it contains no examples of moral grandeur among its characters — no statesmen, no emperors, no worthies of any kind. All we have are some girls, remarkable, it is true, for their passion or folly, but scarcely for their erudition or virtue. In all conscience, I cannot see that it would be suitable for publication.""  

The Stone smiled in acknowledgement of the force of his words.  
""Reverend sir,"" it said, ""why must you be so hidebound? True, my story contains no reference to famous statesmen and contains no moral maxims. It is merely a record of certain of the remarkable girls I have known in my life — a record of their words and deeds, more memorable, it seems to me, than those of the ‘virtuous types’ of earlier literature. As for the dates, I see no difficulty about them. All you need do is take the years of some earlier or later reign-period and tack them on. Surely the important thing in a novel is whether or not it reads well. Why all this fuss about dates?  

""Moreover, the sort of books that are written about government and social morality are seldom very entertaining to read. The trouble with so-called ‘historical romances’ is that most of them contain such a mass of tedious detail about military arrangements, siege-works, battles and so forth, or consist of interminable official documents. And even those which purport to deal with domestic matters are mostly so stylized as to be unnatural.  

""Much worse, though, are the ‘boudoir romances’. Not only are they strewn with characters and incidents that are completely incredible; their language is horribly stilted. And to cap it all, they are for the most part immoral, and give a quite false picture of the relations between the sexes.  

""Then there are the ‘beauty-and-talented-scholar’ romances. These are even worse. In writing this sort of stuff, the authors merely show off their own worthless poetic compositions, and fill their pages with idealized heroines of impossible virtue and refinement. The language of these books is nauseatingly pedantic.  

""My own story is quite different. The plot may be no more than a record of the meetings and partings of a number of persons, but it is at least written in a plain, simple style and based on my own observations and experiences. I have not tried to invent anything extraordinary or marvellous. I have not sought to idealize the characters. I hope that the events of my story, if they cannot dispel boredom or afford a few laughs, will at least provide some harmless entertainment for the reader in his leisure hours and save him the trouble of going to the bad in search of pleasure.  

""Another thing. The storytellers of today, when they want to give a fillip to their story, invariably introduce a ‘talented scholar’ and a ‘beautiful girl’. I have deliberately avoided that stereotype. What I offer is, I think, something new and original."""
"After hearing this, the Taoist in Vacuity pondered for a while, then picked up the *Story of the Stone* to reread. He noticed that although the book contained passages denouncing treachery and censuring wickedness, or disparaging evil and condemning excess, it was not truly directed at the evils of the time. Moreover, it sang the praises of benevolent rulers, faithful ministers, kind fathers, and filial sons, touching upon all aspects of morality with endless admiration and commendation—truly incomparable to other books. Although its main theme was love, it merely recorded actual events and was not guilty of that unrestrained license and reckless fabrication so common in books that dwell on illicit assignations and secret vows. Since it had no connection with the affairs of the time, he copied it out from beginning to end and took it into the world to pass on as a tale of wonder.

Thus it was that the Taoist in Vacuity, starting from a contemplation of vacuity, came to the perception of form; from form he engendered love; by love he penetrated to its inner nature. Then, perceiving the inner nature of love, he again returned to vacuity. So he changed his name to the Monks in Love and changed the title of the book from *The Story of the Stone* to *The Record of the Monks in Love*. Kong Meixi from Eastern Lu called it *The Precious Mirror of Love*. Later, Cao Xueqin, in his Mourning-the-Red Studio, pored over the book for ten years and rewrote it five times. He divided it into chapters, furnished it with a table of contents, and renamed it *The Twelve Beauties of Jinling*. He also inscribed this verse on it:"
"Pages full of fantastic talk,
Tears shed in bitter woes;
All men the writer call a fool,
None his secret message knows."
"With this clarity established, let us proceed to see what was recorded on the stone. The inscription read:"
"Long, long ago, the world was tilted downwards in the southeast, and in that southeast part below was a place called Gusu, in which the district of Changmen was the most fashionable and populous centre of wealth and nobility. Outside Changmen was a certain Ten-li Street, off which ran the Lane of Humanity and Purity, in which stood an old temple, called, from its cramped position, Gourd Temple. Next door to this temple lived a gentleman named Zhen Fei, whose courtesy name was Shiyin. His wife, née Feng, was a worthy, virtuous woman with a strong sense of propriety and right. Although not wealthy, his family was regarded in that neighbourhood as being in easy circumstances.

Zhen Shiyin was by nature a quiet and unambitious person, oblivious of fame and fortune. He was content to spend his time, as a recluse, enjoying the beauty of flowers and bamboos, sipping his wine and composing poems—in short, as a very paragon of a life of leisure. One thing only was lacking: he was now in his fifties and had neither son nor daughter. He did have a daughter, but she was only three. Her name was Yinglian."
"One long hot summer day, Shi-yin was sitting idly in his study when he grew tired of reading and fell asleep over his desk. He dreamed that he had wandered to some place he could not identify, where he suddenly noticed a monk and a Taoist approaching him, talking as they walked."
"Just then they heard the Taoist ask, “Where do you mean to take that stupid object?” The monk laughed. “Don’t worry,” he said. “A romantic story is now waiting to be enacted. A number of amorous spirits have not yet been incarnated. This is our chance to slip this silly thing in among them and give it a taste of life.”

“So more romantic spirits are on their way to the dusty world to undergo their trials,” remarked the Taoist. “Where will they go?”

“It’s an amusing story.” The monk smiled. “You’ve never heard anything like it. In the west, on the bank of the Sacred River, beside the Stone of Three Incarnations, there grew a Vermilion Pearl Plant. It was watered every day with sweet dew by the attendant Shen Ying in the Palace of Red Jade. Thus imbibing the essences of heaven and earth and the nourishment of rain and dew, it cast off its plant nature and took human form, albeit that of a girl. All day she roamed beyond the Sphere of Parting Sorrow, staying her hunger with the fruit Secret Love and quenching her thirst at the Sea of Brimming Grief. But her heart was heavy because she had not repaid the care lavished on her.

“Just then Shen Ying was moved by a foolish impulse to assume human form and go down into the world to pass through the mill of fortune, already registering with the Goddess of Disenchantment. She in turn had ascertained that this plant had not repaid the other’s kindness.

“‘He gave me sweet dew,’ said the girl, ‘but I’ve no water to repay his kindness. If he’s going down to the world of men, I would like to go too so that if I repay him with as many tears as I can shed in a lifetime I may be able to clear this debt.’

“This induced many other amorous spirits to accompany them and take part in this romance.”"
"The Taoist exclaimed, ""This is truly unheard-of. I've never come across a story about repaying tears. I imagine this tale must be more intricate and detailed than any typical romance."" The monk replied, ""Throughout history, there have been only a few romantic figures whose stories have been passed down in broad outlines, along with their poems and verses. The daily life within households and women's quarters—every meal and drink—has never been recorded. Moreover, most romantic tales merely involve secret affairs and elopements, never truly capturing the genuine emotions between men and women. It seems that when this group of individuals enters the world, their passionate obsessions, foolish infatuations, and the mix of virtue and vice will differ entirely from the stories told of their predecessors."" The Taoist said, ""Why don't we take this opportunity to descend into the world and guide a few souls? Wouldn't that be a virtuous deed?"" The monk responded, ""Exactly my thought. First, accompany me to the palace of the Goddess of Illusion to settle matters with this dull object. Once these romantic troublemakers have all descended into the mortal realm, we can follow. Although half of them have already fallen into the world of dust, the group is not yet complete."" The Taoist said, ""In that case, I shall follow you."""
"Now, Zhen Shiyin had heard every word of their conversation, but could not make out what was meant by ""the stupid thing."" He could not resist stepping forward to make a bow and say with a smile, ""Venerable Immortals, I greet you."" The monk and Taoist returned his greeting and asked what he wanted. ""It was hard not to overhear the talk of karma you Venerable Immortals were indulging in,"" said Shiyin. ""Of course, a dull-witted person like myself cannot hope to fathom the mysteries you were discussing, but I am eager to profit from your advice. If you would take pity on my stupidity and enlighten me a little, I promise to listen most attentively. It might possibly have the effect of rescuing me from my sea of suffering.""

The two immortals smiled. ""This is a celestial mystery and we cannot divulge it,"" they said. ""But when the time comes, don't forget us two and you may be able to escape from the fiery pit.""

Shiyin saw that it was no use pressing them. ""A celestial mystery cannot be divulged,"" he said, ""But what was the 'stupid thing' of which you spoke? I'd like to know if I might see it.""

""If you ask about that thing,"" said the monk, ""I am fated to have a glimpse of it."" With that he drew it out and handed it to Shiyin."
"Shi-yin took the stone and saw that it was a clear, beautiful jade on which characters were inscribed. He read the words ""Magic Jade"" and could also make out the couple of smaller characters on the reverse side. Just as he was about to examine it more closely the monk said, ""We have arrived at the Land of Illusion,"" and snatched the stone from him. He then disappeared through a big stone archway above which

THE LAND OF ILLUSION

was written in large characters. A couplet in smaller characters was inscribed on the two sides:"
"When false is taken for true, true becomes false; If non-being turns into being, being becomes non-being."
"Shi-yin was about to follow them, but found himself rooted to the spot. A great crash like the collapse of a mountain followed by the subsidence of the earth made him cry out in alarm. He looked up and saw the sun blazing down on the luxuriant plantain leaves, the dream already half-forgotten. He watched the nurse approach with Ying-lian in her arms. The child, now even more exquisitely lovely, with her delicate skin and pretty ways, stretched out her arms to her father with a beguiling smile. Shi-yin reached out for her and, holding her in his own, dandled and played with her for a while before taking her out to the front of the house to watch the bustle of the festival procession."
"Just as he was about to go in, he caught sight of a Buddhist monk and a Taoist priest approaching from the other side. The monk had a scabby head and bare feet, while the priest was lame, with disheveled hair and a wild, eccentric demeanor, chatting and laughing boisterously as they came. When they reached Shi-yin’s gate and saw him holding Ying-lian, the monk burst into loud sobs. “Why are you holding that ill-fated creature, who brings nothing but trouble to her parents?” he asked Shi-yin. Hearing what sounded like ravings, Shi-yin paid him no attention. But the monk persisted, “Give her to me! Give her to me!” Growing impatient, Shi-yin clasped his daughter and turned to go back inside. The monk pointed at him, laughed heartily, and then recited these lines:"
"Foolish to indulge your whims and pamper you in every way, While the mirror reflects the riven ice on a cold day. Guard well the Feast of Lanterns that is coming by and by, For after the fire is put out, all will in ruins lie."
"Shi-yin had heard every word clearly, and hesitated, meaning to ask their history. But he heard the Taoist say, “There is no need for us to go together. You go about your business and I’ll go about mine. After three aeons I shall wait for you on Mount Beimang, and we can go together to the Illusory Land of the Great Void to have our names erased from the register.”

“Wonderful, wonderful!” exclaimed the monk. And at that they parted, each going his way, and soon were lost to sight.

“They must have some history,” thought Shi-yin. “I should have asked them, but now it’s too late.”"
"Lost in thought, Shiyin suddenly noticed the arrival of a poor scholar who lived next door in Gourd Temple. His name was Jia Hua, courtesy name Shifei, and pseudonym Yucun. Originally from Huzhou, he came from a family of scholars and officials. However, having been born in a time of decline, with his family's fortunes and lineage exhausted and the household dwindled, he found himself alone and adrift. Seeing no future in his hometown, he set out for the capital to seek fame and restore his family's legacy. But after arriving two years prior, his plans had stalled, and he now lodged in the temple, making a living by selling calligraphy and writing essays. This was how he and Shiyin had become acquainted."
"When Yucun saw Shiyin, he hurriedly bowed and greeted him with a smile, saying, ""Sir, you've been standing at your gate watching the street. Is there perchance any news in the town?"" Shiyin replied, ""None whatever. But just now my little girl was crying, so I brought her out to play. I was feeling extremely bored, and you, brother, have come just in time to keep me company. Please come into my small library, and we can help each other to while away this tedious day.""

So saying, he sent the child inside and led Yucun into his study, where a boy served tea. But they had not exchanged many words when one of the household came running in to announce, ""Lord Yan has come to call."" At once Shiyin excused himself and said, ""Forgive my rudeness. Do you mind waiting here for a few moments?"" ""Don't stand on ceremony, sir,"" said Yucun, rising. ""I am a regular guest here. I don't mind waiting."" By then Shiyin was already in the front hall."
"Yucun was leafing through some books to while away the time when he heard a woman coughing outside. He got up and looked out of the window. It was a maid picking flowers. She had fresh, delicate features and was by no means vulgar; and, although no great beauty, she had considerable charm. Yucun stared at her, spell-bound."
"As the young maid started away, flowers in hand, she raised her eyes too soon and caught sight of a man in the study. He was wearing a scarf and a shabby old gown. Poor though he looked, he had a broad forehead, a square jaw, a thick torso and a powerful back. Moreover, his eyebrows were swordlike, his eyes starry, his nose straight, his cheeks firm. She turned away and slipped out of sight.

""He may be poor, but he looks anything but common,"" she thought. ""I shouldn't be surprised if this is Chia Yu-tsun. My master's often said he means to help him, but hasn't yet found a chance. Yes, this must be the man -- we've no other relatives as poor as this. No wonder my master also says he's a man who won't remain long in this plight."" She could not resist looking back a couple of times."
"When Yucun saw her turn back, he assumed she had taken a fancy to him and was overjoyed, thinking her a girl of uncommon discernment and a friend worth having in his struggling career.

Just then the boy came in and Yucun learned that his host was staying to a meal. Unable to wait any longer, he went out through a side gate.

Shiyin did not press him to stay when the other guests had left."
"One day, the Mid-Autumn Festival arrived early. After the family feast, Shiyin had another table laid in his study and strolled on his own, guided by the moonlight, to the temple to invite Yucun. Since the day Yucun had caught sight of the Zhen family maid glancing back at him twice, he had considered her a kindred spirit and often thought of her. Now, on this Mid-Autumn Festival, his feelings stirred by the moon, he spontaneously composed a poem in the regulated verse form."
"Could I one heart's wish divine,
Which still with sorrow made me pine?
Oft as came grief, with knitted brow I sighed;
When she was gone, much I turned round to gaze.
My shadow in the wind I can descry;
Who is there fit a partner to be made?
The moonbeams, if they my wish read, should fly,
And first of all her beauteous lodge invade."
"After reciting these lines, Yu-tsun thought of his unrealized ambitions and, with a sigh, chanted these couplets as he looked up at the sky:"
"Jade seeks a worthy price in the mart,  
In the box the pin awaits its flight."
"Just then Shiyin came up and, overhearing these remarks, said with a smile, “I see you have high ambitions, Brother Yucun.”

“Not in the least,” replied Yucun, rising with an answering smile. “I was merely reciting some lines by a former poet. I’ve done nothing to deserve such a compliment.” He inquired where Shiyin had been.

“I spent the festival with my wife,” was the reply. “But tonight being the mid-autumn feast, commonly known as the festival of reunion, I thought you might be feeling lonely in this temple, brother. I’ve prepared a little wine in my humble place and wonder if you’d condescend to share some with me?”

Yucun needed no pressing. “I’m much obliged for your kindness,” he said. “I was just feeling rather depressed, and this is most good of you.” So he accompanied Shiyin to the adjoining court."
"Soon they had finished their tea and the table was laid. The excellence of the wine and dishes we need not dwell on. They took their seats and at first drank slowly, but as they talked their spirits rose and they began to drink more recklessly. The streets were now quiet, music and singing could be heard from every house, and the rim of the moon above made the scene seem doubly bright as they grew more and more merry. Yu-tsun, for his part, was now eight parts drunk and could not suppress his exultation. He improvised a quatrain to the moon and chanted it:"
"On the fifteenth night the full moon is bright,
Pouring its lustre round on gem-trellised height.
As that bright orb climbs up the sky,
All men on earth gaze up with wondering eye."
"Upon hearing this, Shiyin cried out with delight, ""Excellent! I’ve always maintained that you were not one doomed to long remain in an inferior position. Now the lines you have just chanted are an auspicious sign. Very soon you will be ‘stepping up to the clouds’ on a lucky journey. Let me congratulate you."" He at once called for a fresh pot of wine to celebrate.

Yucun drained the cup. ""I am not boasting when I say this,"" he remarked, ""but I believe that, when it comes to modern polite learning, I am not unaccomplished. The only problem is that I have no money for the journey to the capital, and the distance makes it impossible to get there by selling calligraphy or essays.""

""Why didn’t you say so before?"" exclaimed Shiyin. ""I have often thought of this but, not having heard you mention it, feared I might be presumptuous. If things are as you say, with your talents I’m sure you will succeed. It is lucky that the next triennial examination is due soon. You must go to the capital without delay. In the spring test you are bound to distinguish yourself and prove your worth. I shall consider it a privilege to take care of your travelling expenses and other expenses."" He sent his boy in to fetch fifty tacels of silver and two winter coats.

""The nineteenth of this month is a good day for travelling,"" he went on. ""You can hire a boat then and start your journey west. How good it will be to meet again next winter after you have soared up to dizzy heights.""

Yucun accepted the silver and clothes with no more than perfunctory thanks, remarking that they were not worth mentioning. All the same, they went on drinking and talking until late that night, when they parted."
"After seeing Yucun off, Shiyin went back to his room and slept straight through until the sun was high in the sky. When he awoke, his thoughts turned to the events of the previous night and he resolved to write a couple of letters of recommendation for Yucun to take with him to the capital, arranging for him to stay with some officials who were his own friends. But when he sent a servant to ask Yucun round, the man came back with the message that 'the monk said that Mr Jia had set off for the capital at the fifth watch this morning. He also said that he asked the monk to tell you, sir, that ""a scholar doesn't worry about lucky times or days, and when it's a question of doing what's right, he doesn't wait to say his goodbyes in person.""' Shiyin, on hearing this, had to let the matter drop."
"Indeed, time speeds by in idleness, and in a flash it was the Feast of Lanterns. Shi-yin told his servant Huo Qi to take Ying-lian out to see the mummers and the coloured lanterns. Towards midnight Huo Qi, wanting to relieve himself, put Ying-lian down on a doorstep. When he came back she had gone. He searched for her frantically all night, and at dawn, having failed to find any trace of her, he was too frightened to go back and face his master and fled to another district.

Shi-yin and his wife knew that something must have happened when their daughter failed to come home. Then the servants sent out to search came back empty-handed. The loss of this only daughter, the child of their declining years, plunged them into deepest grief. They wept day and night, ready to give up the ghost. Then Shi-yin fell ill. His wife did her best to nurse him, but presently she too fell ill. So they called in the doctors every day."
"It so happened that on the fifteenth of the third month, while the monks of the Gourd Temple were frying sweetmeats for an offering, some careless hand let the oil spill from the cauldron, setting fire to the paper window. And since most of the houses in this district had bamboo fences and wooden walls, being doomed to destruction anyway, the fire spread from house to house until the whole street was blazing like a mountain of flame. Although soldiers and civilians tried to put it out, the fire was now too strong to be checked. It roared on for a whole night until it died down of itself, destroying no one knows how many houses. Worse still, the Zhen house next door to the temple was reduced to a pile of rubble, and though the family escaped with their lives, Zhen Shiyin could only stamp his feet and sigh in despair. After discussing with his wife, they decided to settle on his farm. But the last few years had seen poor harvests and a spate of banditry, and government troops were seizing men and looting everywhere so that the people were growing more rebellious every day. Thwarted in this plan, Shiyin had to mortgage his land and take his wife and two maids to find refuge with his father-in-law."
"His father-in-law, Feng Su by name, was a native of Ta-ju Chou. Though only a farmer, he was comfortably off. He was not a little disgusted at the wretched state in which his son-in-law made his appearance. Luckily Shih-yin had in his possession the money he had realized from the sale of his property, and he now produced it and handed it to his father-in-law, commissioning him to buy, whenever a suitable opportunity occurred, a certain amount of fixed property as a provision against future eventualities. Feng Su, however, only appropriated the money in a lump sum for his own use, and went and purchased some fallow fields for Shih-yin. But Shih-yin was a scholar, and had no knowledge of agricultural matters, so that in less than a year or two, he became poorer and poorer, while Feng Su would whenever he met him treat him to a string of abuse. Shih-yin, within himself, gave way to regret. Then, again, he had had to go through the anguish of a father and mother, and the distress he had endured had, besides, brought on a sickness, so that, what with his advancing years and the straits of poverty and illness, he began gradually to display symptoms of decline."
"As luck would have it, he managed with the aid of his stick to drag himself to the highway one day to take a little stroll. Suddenly he caught sight of a Taoist approach—a lame one with tousled hair and a distraught air, who wore hemp sandals and tattered clothes. He was chanting:"
"All men long to be immortals,
Yet to riches and rank each aspires;
The great ones of old, where are they now?
Their graves are a mass of briars.

All men long to be immortals,
Yet silver and gold they prize
And grub for money all their lives
Till death seals up their eyes.

All men long to be immortals
Yet dote on the wives they've wed,
Who swear to love their husband evermore
But remarry as soon as he's dead.

All men long to be immortals
Yet with getting sons won't have done.
Although fond parents are legion,
Who ever saw a really filial son?"
"Shi-yin approached the Taoist and asked, ""What is all this you are saying? All I can make out is a lot of 'won' and 'done'.""

The Taoist laughed. ""If you can make out 'won' and 'done',"" he said, ""you may be said to have understood; for in all the affairs of this world what is won is done, and what is done is won; for whoever has not yet done has not yet won, and in order to have won, one must first have done. I shall call my song the 'Won-Done Song'.""

Now Shi-yin was a man of keen intelligence. As soon as he heard these words, the seeds of understanding were sown in his breast. He therefore smiled back at the Taoist.

""Just a minute,"" he said. ""How would you like me to provide your 'Won-Done Song' with a commentary?""

""By all means,"" said the Taoist; and Shi-yin proceeded to speak as follows:"
"Mean huts and empty halls
Where emblems of nobility once hung;
Dead weeds and withered trees,
Where men have once danced and sung.
Carved beams are swathed in cobwebs,
But green gauze once more curtains the window bare.
Too much rouge and face-powder, you may declare;
Yet why should both temples now be hoar?
Yesterday, yellow clay received white bones;
Today, red lanterns light the love-birds' nest;
While men with gold and silver by the chest
Turn beggars, scorned by all the rest.
A life cut short one moment makes one sigh,
But who knows himself when his doom is nigh?
A kindly upbringing a child may grace,
But who can guess what that child's future place?
Some become bandits lost to shame and truth
Because they have chosen a rich husband in their youth;
Some fall so low as to be a prostitute—
Is that a fate a gentle maid should meet?
Intoxicated with power, some are ruined;
Some from starvation are saved in the nick of time,
Though life is still a puzzle hard to solve.
While one is in mourning, in another wedding-chimes tinkle.
So cawing magpies herald a lucky day,
And croaking ravens predict death's gloom.
In this world all are players in their turn;
They take the world for their own native place—
How far they have wondered from the truth!
All their labor, all their busyness,
Is no more than making clothes for someone else to wear."
"Upon hearing this, the mad, lame Taoist clapped his hands and laughed, saying, ""You've hit the mark, you've hit the mark!"" Shiyin then exclaimed, ""Let's go!"" and, snatching the satchel from the Taoist's shoulder, he slung it over his own. Without returning home, he drifted away with the mad Taoist.

This immediately stirred up the neighborhood, and everyone spread the story as a piece of sensational news. When Lady Feng heard the news, she wept as if her heart would break. She had no choice but to consult with her father and send people everywhere to search for him, but no trace of him was found. Left with no alternative, she had to rely on her parents for support. Fortunately, she still had two maids from earlier days to attend to her, and the three of them—mistress and servants—spent their days and nights doing needlework to sell, helping with the household expenses. Though Feng Su grumbled daily, there was nothing he could do about the situation."
"One day, as the Zhen family’s senior maid was buying thread at the gate, she heard shouting in the street. Everyone was saying that the new prefect had arrived. The maid hid inside the gate to watch and saw a procession of guards and runners passing by in pairs, followed by a large sedan chair carrying an official in a black hat and crimson robe. The maid was startled, thinking the official looked familiar, as if she had seen him somewhere before. She went back to her room but soon put the matter out of her mind. That evening, just as she was about to retire, there came a loud knocking at the gate, and many voices shouted, ""The prefect has sent us to summon someone for questioning."" Feng Su, upon hearing this, was terrified, his eyes wide and his mouth agape, not knowing what misfortune was about to befall them. To find out what happened next, read on."
