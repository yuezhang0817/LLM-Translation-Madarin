"But let us return to Yucun. As he turned to look, he was surprised to see that it was Zhang Rugui, a former colleague who had been cashiered at the same time and for the same reason as himself. A native of these parts, Zhang Rugui had been living at home since his dismissal. Having just heard that a motion had been presented in the capital for the reinstatement of former officials, he had been dashing about to find pull, and had run into Yucun by a happy coincidence. After an exchange of greetings, he told Yucun the news, which delighted him.

After a hurried conversation they separated, each going his own way. When Leng Zixing heard the news he promptly worked out a plan for Yucun. He advised him to ask Lin Ruhai to write to his brother-in-law in the capital, Jia Zheng, and enlist his help.

Yucun accepted his advice and went back to his lodgings to think it over. He looked up the Court Gazette to make sure the news was true."
"The next day he went to see Lin Ruhai and told him his plan.

“What a lucky coincidence!” exclaimed Ruhai. “After my wife’s death my mother-in-law in the capital was worried because my daughter had no one to bring her up. She had sent two boats with male and female attendants to fetch her, but I delayed her departure because she was unwell. I was wondering how to repay you for your goodness in teaching her: this is the chance to show my gratitude. Set your mind at rest. I have made the necessary preparations. I shall write a letter to my brother-in-law urging him to do all he can for you, which will be some small return for your virtue. I shall also cover any expenses that may be incurred, as I shall explain in my letter, so that you need not worry about any outlay.”

Yucun bowed with profuse thanks.

“May I ask your respected brother-in-law’s position?” he inquired. “I am afraid I may be too uncouth to intrude on him.”

Ruhai smiled. “My two brothers-in-law are both your kinsmen, for they are the grandsons of the Duke of Rongguo. The elder, Jia She, whose courtesy name is Enhou, is a hereditary general of the first rank. The younger, Jia Zheng, whose courtesy name is Cunzhou, is an under-secretary in the Board of Works. He is unassuming and generous, a true gentleman who takes after his grandfather. That is why I mean to write to him. If I thought you might meet with any discourtesy, I wouldn’t send you to him for fear of damaging your integrity — I have too high a regard for you.”

Then Yucun knew that Zixing’s story the previous day had been true, and he once more expressed his thanks.

Ruhai prepared a farewell feast for him and presented him with two sets of winter clothes as well as the money for the journey. And Yucun’s pupil, who had not yet fully recovered, was very upset at parting with her tutor.

Yucun took a boat to the capital, and the moment he reached it he repaired to the Rong Mansion, where he handed in his visiting-card on which he had styled himself Jia Zheng’s “nephew.”

Jia Zheng, who had received his brother-in-law’s letter, lost no time in asking him in. Yucun cut an impressive figure and was a good talker. Since Jia Zheng was well-disposed to scholars and, like his grandfather before him, delighted in honouring worthy men of letters and helping those in distress, he treated his visitor with exceptional consideration and did all in his power to help him. The same day Yucun sent in a petition to the throne, and in less than two months he was appointed to the prefectship of Yingtianfu in Jinling. Taking leave of Jia Zheng he chose a day to proceed to his new post. But no more of this."
"The young student Daiyu, having just recovered from her illness, was naturally reluctant to abandon her father and depart. However, her grandmother insisted that she must go, and her father, Ruhai, added, ""I am nearing fifty and have no intention of taking another wife. You are often ill, still very young, and without a mother to guide you or siblings to support you. If you go and stay with your grandmother and your cousins, it will ease my worries about your well-being. Why do you refuse to go?"" Upon hearing this, Daiyu, with tears in her eyes, bid farewell and boarded the boat with her nurse and several elderly maids from the Rong Mansion. Yucun had another boat, accompanied by two young attendants, and followed closely behind Daiyu's vessel."
"One day he reached the capital and entered the city. Yucun first donned clean clothes and, with his page boy, brought his visiting-card to the gate of the Rong Mansion.

Now Jia Zheng had already read his brother-in-law’s letter and promptly asked him in. Yucun cut a fine figure, was dignified and well-spoken. Since Jia Zheng was well-disposed to scholars and, like his grandfather before him, delighted in honouring worthy men of letters and helping those in distress, and since his brother-in-law had recommended Yucun, he treated him uncommonly well and did all in his power to help him. The same day he submitted a report to the throne, and Yucun was rehabilitated and ordered to await an appointment. In less than two months he was sent to Jinling to fill the vacated post of prefect of Yingtian. Taking leave of Jia Zheng he chose a day to proceed to his new post. But no more of this."
"Now on the day when she left the boat and mounted the carriage, she had seen the curtains and trappings of the Jung Mansion equipages were of unexampled luxury and splendour; and Lin Tai-yü had often heard her mother recount how different was her grandmother’s house from that of other people. From the looks and style of the maids and married women, who belonged to the three inferior classes, whom she had seen that day, she could readily form an idea of all that would meet her eyes. She was therefore obliged to be careful in every act, and watchful at every step, for fear lest any one should ridicule her; and whenever she spoke, she had to be guarded in every sentence, and cautious in every word."
"As she got into her palanquin and was carried into the city, she peeped out through the gauze window at the bustle and splendour of the streets, the crowds of people, the continuous succession of shops and taverns — quite unlike anything she had ever seen before.

After what seemed a long time they came to a street with two huge stone lions crouching on the north side, flanking a great triple gate with beast-head knockers, in front of which ten or more men in smart livery were sitting. The central gate was closed, but people were passing in and out of the smaller side gates. On a board above the main gate was written in large characters: Ningguo Mansion Founded by Imperial Command.

""This must be where my elder uncle lives,"" thought Daiyu.

A little further on they came to another imposing triple gate. This was the Rong Mansion. Instead of going through the main gate, they entered by the smaller one on the west. The bearers carried the palanquin some distance, then set it down at a turning and withdrew. The maid-servants behind Daiyu had now alighted and came forward to help her out of the chair.

She saw that they had carried her to a place with a screen wall painted a dark reddish-brown colour. As she passed through the small gate in this wall she saw a corridor running from east to west and a hall with a door-screen of polished wood in the middle. The bearers now raised the door-screen and a voice announced, ""Miss Lin is here.""

As she entered the hall she saw an old lady supported by two maids approach her. She knew that this must be her grandmother, but before she could curtsey she was clasped in the old lady's arms and pressed to her bosom.

""My dear heart! Flesh of my child!"" cried her grandmother with a storm of sobbing. All the attendants, affected by this meeting between grandmother and motherless child, covered their faces and wept too, and Daiyu herself felt tears welling up in her eyes. When at last the others had succeeded in calming them a little, Daiyu made her curtsey. This done, her grandmother introduced those present.

""This,"" she said, ""is your elder uncle's wife. This is your second uncle's wife. This is the wife of your late Cousin Zhu.""

Daiyu greeted each in turn.

""Fetch the girls,"" her grandmother said. ""They can be excused their lessons today in honour of our guest from far away.""

Thereupon two maids went to do her bidding. And presently the three young ladies appeared, escorted by three nurses and five or six maids.

The first was somewhat plump and of medium height. Her cheeks were the texture of newly ripened lichees — all dewy freshness. Her nose was as sleek and shiny as goose fat. She had a gentle, sweet temper and looked very approachable.

The second had sloping shoulders and a slender waist. She was tall and slim, with an oval face, well-defined eyebrows and lovely dancing eyes. She seemed elegant and quick-witted with an air of distinction. To look at her was to forget everything vulgar.

The third was not yet fully grown and still had the face of a child.

All four were dressed in similar tunics and skirts with the same bracelets and head ornaments.

Daiyu rose to meet these cousins and they exchanged greetings. When they were seated and tea had been served she was able to examine them more closely. But she was struck most of all by the second girl.

Her eyebrows had the curviness of a leaf being tossed in the hills. Her eyes held the liquid sparkle of a pool in autumn. Her face had the delicate contours of a flower, her movements the grace of a willow in the wind. She looked sensitive and highly strung. The fullness of her lips suggested passion; the blue veins on her forehead, a quick temper; and her dark, liquid eyes held a bewitching power.

After tea, some conversation followed in which Daiyu was questioned about her mother — how she had fallen ill, what medicine she had taken, what arrangements had been made for her funeral and burial. When her grandmother heard how her daughter had been struck down and carried off so suddenly she was overcome with fresh grief.

""Of all my children I loved your mother best,"" she said. ""Now she has gone before me, and I didn't even have one last glimpse of her face. The sight of you makes me feel my loss all the more keenly."" Clasping Daiyu again to her bosom she wept. The others were hard put to it to comfort her.

All present had been struck by Daiyu's good breeding. For in spite of her tender years and evident delicate health, she had an air of natural distinction. Observing how frail she looked they asked what medicine or treatment she had been having.

""I've always been like this,"" Daiyu said with a smile. ""I've been taking medicine ever since I was weaned. Many well-known doctors have examined me, but none of their prescriptions was any use. When I was three, a mangy-headed Buddhist monk came to our house and wanted to take me away to be a nun. My parents wouldn't hear of it. So he said, 'If you can't bear to part with her she'll probably never get well. The only other remedy is to keep her from hearing weeping and from seeing any relatives apart from her father and mother. Then she may have a chance of living to a ripe old age.' Of course, he was only talking nonsense; we didn't believe a word of it. Now I'm still taking ginseng pills.""

""What a good thing you are taking them,"" exclaimed her grandmother. ""We were just going to ask the doctor to call and prescribe for you.""

As she was speaking, a sound of laughter was heard from the back courtyard and a voice cried:

""I'm late in greeting our guest from afar!""

Daiyu thought with surprise, ""The people here are so respectful and solemn, they all seem to be holding their breath. Who can this be, so boisterous and pert?""

While she was still wondering, through the back door trooped some matrons and maids surrounding a young woman. Unlike the girls, she was richly dressed and resplendent as a fairy.

Her gold-filigree tiara was set with jewels and pearls. Her hair-clasps, in the form of five phoenixes facing the sun, had pendants of pearls. Her necklet, of red gold, was in the form of a coiled dragon studded with gems. She had double red jade pendants with pea-green tassels attached to her skirt.

Her close-fitting red satin jacket was embroidered with gold butterflies and flowers. Her turquoise cape, lined with white squirrel, was inset with designs in coloured silk. Her skirt of kingfisher-blue crepe was patterned with flowers.

She had the almond-shaped eyes of a phoenix and slanting eyebrows as long and drooping as willow leaves. Her figure was slender and her manner vivacious. The springtime charm of her powdered face gave no hint of her latent formidability. And before her crimson lips parted, her laughter rang out.

Daiyu rose quickly to greet her.

""You don't know her yet."" The Lady Dowager chuckled. ""She's the terror of this house. In the south they'd call her Hot Pepper. Just call her Fiery Phoenix.""

Daiyu was at a loss how to address her when her cousins came to her rescue. ""This is Cousin Lian's wife,"" they told her.

Though Daiyu had never met her, she knew from her mother that Chia Lien, the son of her first uncle Chia Sheh, had married the niece of Lady Wang, her second uncle's wife. She had been educated like a boy and given the school-room name Hsi-feng. Daiyu lost no time in greeting her with a smile as ""cousin.""

Hsi-feng took her hand and carefully inspected her from head to foot, then led her back to her seat by the Lady Dowager.

""Well,"" she cried with a laugh, ""this is the first time I've set eyes on such a ravishing beauty. Her whole air is so distinguished! She doesn't take after her father, son-in-law of our Old Ancestress, but looks more like a Chia. No wonder our Old Ancestress couldn't put you out of her mind and was for ever talking or thinking about you. But poor ill-fated little cousin, losing your mother so young!"" With that she dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief.

""I've only just dried my tears. Do you want to start me off again?"" said the old lady playfully. ""Your young cousin's had a long journey and she's delicate. We've just got her to stop crying. So don't reopen that subject.""

Hsi-feng switched at once from grief to merriment. ""Of course,"" she cried. ""I was so carried away by joy and sorrow at sight of my little cousin, I forgot our Old Ancestress. I deserve to be caned."" Taking Daiyu's hand again, she asked, ""How old are you, cousin? Have you started your schooling yet? What medicine are you taking? You mustn't be homesick here. If you fancy anything special to eat or play with, don't hesitate to tell me. If the maids or old nurses aren't good to you, just let me know.""

She turned then to the servants. ""Have Miss Lin's luggage and things been brought in? How many attendants did she"
"As Dai-yu entered the room, she saw two maids supporting a silver-haired old lady coming forward to greet her. She knew this must be her grandmother. Just as she was about to kneel and pay her respects, the old lady clasped her to her bosom.

“My pet! My poor darling!” she cried in tears. “I have no one left but you now!”

All the attendants covered their faces and wept, and Dai-yu herself could not keep back her tears. When at last the others had prevailed on them to stop weeping, Dai-yu made her kowtow to her grandmother. This lady was the mother of Jia She and Jia Zheng, the Dowager Lady Shi mentioned by Leng Zixing.

The old lady now introduced those present. “This,” she said, “is your elder uncle’s wife. This is your second uncle’s wife. This is the wife of your late Cousin Zhu, Lian’s wife.”

Dai-yu greeted each in turn.

“Fetch the girls,” the old lady said. “They can be excused their lessons today as we have a visitor from far away.”

Two maids went to do as they were told."
"Before long, three girls arrived, escorted by three nurses and five or six maids. The first was somewhat plump and of medium height. Her cheeks were the texture of newly ripened lichees, her nose as sleek as goose fat. Gentle and demure, she looked very approachable. The second had sloping shoulders and a slender waist. She was tall and slim, with an oval face, well-defined eyebrows and lovely dancing eyes. She seemed elegant and quick-witted with an air of distinction. To all appearances a cut above the rest. The third was not yet fully grown and still had the face of a child. All three were dressed in similar tunics and skirts with the same bracelets and hair ornaments. Daiyu rose quickly to greet them and after an exchange of courtesies they took seats while the maids served tea. The conversation naturally turned to Daiyu’s mother, how she had fallen ill, what doctors had attended her, what medicine she had taken and how she had been buried and mourned. Naturally, the Lady Dowager was deeply distressed. “Of all my children I loved your mother best,” she told Daiyu. “Now she has gone before me, and I didn’t even have one last glimpse of her face. The sight of you makes my heart ache!” She clasped Daiyu to her breast and wept again. The others found it hard to comfort her. Not until they had pleaded with her for some time did she at last dry her tears."
"Though Tai-yu was young, her speech and manners already showed unusual refinement. Though she had a frail look, her natural charms were enough to catch every eye. And they could see she was not in the best of health.

""What medicine do you usually take?"" they asked. ""Why haven’t you something to cure this?""

""I’ve always been like this,"" said Tai-yu with a smile. ""I’ve taken medicine ever since I was weaned and I’m still under treatment. I’ve seen so many famous doctors and tried so many prescriptions, but it’s never done me any good. When I was three, I remember being told, a scabby-headed monk came to our house and wanted to take me away to be a nun. My parents wouldn’t hear of it. So the monk said, ‘If you can’t bear to part with her, I’m afraid her illness will never get better. And if you want her to get better, she mustn’t ever hear weeping and from now on must never see any relatives apart from her father and mother. Then she’ll be all right and live to a ripe old age.’ Of course, no one paid any attention to such crazy talk. So now I’m still taking ginseng pills.""

""Good,"" said the Lady Dowager. ""We’re making some pills here now. I’ll have them prepare some for you."""
"Before the words were out of her mouth, they heard footsteps in the courtyard and a voice cried:

""I'm late in greeting our guest from afar!""

Dai-yu thought with surprise, ""The people here are so respectful and solemn, they all seem to be holding their breath. Who can this be, so boisterous and pert?""

While she was still wondering, through the back door trooped some matrons and maids surrounding a young woman. Unlike the girls, she was richly dressed and resplendent as a fairy.

Her gold-filigree tiara was set with jewels and pearls. Her hair-clasps, in the form of five phoenixes facing the sun, had pendants of pearls. Her necklet, of red gold, was in the form of a coiled dragon studded with gems. She had double red jade pendants with pea-green tassels attached to her skirt.

Her close-fitting red satin jacket was embroidered with gold butterflies and flowers. Her turquoise cape, lined with white squirrel, was inset with designs in colored silk. Her skirt of kingfisher-blue crepe was patterned with flowers.

She had the almond-shaped eyes of a phoenix, slanting eyebrows as long and drooping as willow leaves. Her figure was slender and her manner vivacious. The springtime charm of her powdered face gave no hint of her latent formidability. And before her crimson lips parted, her laughter rang out.

Dai-yi rose quickly to greet her.

""You don't know her yet."" The Lady Dowager chuckled. ""She's the terror of this house. In the south they'd call her Hot Pepper. Just call her Fiery Phoenix."""
"Daiyu was at a loss how to address her when her cousins came to her rescue. ""This is Cousin Lien's wife,"" they told her.

Though Daiyu had never met her, she knew from her mother that Chia Lien, the son of her first uncle Chia Sheh, had married the niece of Lady Wang, her second uncle's wife. She had been educated like a boy and given the school-room name Hsi-feng. Daiyu lost no time in greeting her with a smile as ""cousin."""
"Xifeng took Daiyu’s hand and carefully inspected her from head to foot before leading her back to her seat by the Lady Dowager. “Well,” she cried with a laugh, “this is the first time I’ve set eyes on such a ravishing beauty. Her whole air is so distinguished! She doesn’t take after her father, son-in-law of our Old Ancestress, but looks more like a Jia. No wonder our Old Ancestress couldn’t put you out of her mind and was for ever talking or thinking about you. But poor ill-fated little cousin, losing your mother so young!” With that she dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief.

“I’ve only just dried my tears. Do you want to start me off again?” said the old lady playfully. “Your young cousin’s had a long journey and she’s delicate. We’ve just got her to stop crying. So don’t reopen that subject.”

Xifeng switched at once from grief to merriment. “Of course,” she cried. “I was so carried away by joy and sorrow at sight of my little cousin, I forgot our Old Ancestress. I deserve to be caned.” Taking Daiyu’s hand again, she asked, “How old are you, cousin? Have you started your schooling yet? What medicine are you taking? You mustn’t be homesick here. If you fancy anything special to eat or play with, don’t hesitate to tell me. If the maids or old nurses aren’t good to you, just let me know.”

She turned to the servants. “Have Miss Lin’s luggage and things been brought in? How many attendants did she bring? Hurry up and clear out a couple of rooms where they can rest.”"
"As she was speaking, tea and refreshments were served. Xifeng herself handed round the cups and plates.

Then her Second Aunt asked whether the monthly allowance had been issued or not.

“It was finished yesterday,” said Xifeng. “Just now I took some people to the upstairs storeroom to look for some brocade. We searched for a long time but couldn’t find any of the sort you described, madam, yesterday. Could your memory have been at fault?”

“It doesn’t matter if there’s none of that sort,” said Lady Wang. “Just choose two lengths to make your little cousin some clothes. It’s too bad it slipped my mind when I was in there just now. I should have told them to fetch it for you in the evening.”

“I’ve already done that,” replied Xifeng. “Knowing my young cousin would be here any day, I got some stuff ready. It’s waiting for your approval, madam.”

With a smile Lady Wang nodded in silent approval."
"Now the refreshments had been cleared away, the Lady Dowager ordered two nurses to take Daiyu to see her two uncles.

At once Jia She's wife, Lady Xing, rose to her feet and suggested with a smile, ""Why not let me take my niece?""

""Very well,"" agreed the Lady Dowager. ""You needn't come back after you've gone.""

Lady Xing assented and then took Daiyu to take her leave of Lady Wang. The rest saw them as far as the entrance hall."
"Upon passing through the ornamental gate, she found several young servants waiting beside a blue-green carriage with kingfisher-blue curtains. Lady Xing took Daiyu by the hand and got in with her. When the maids had let down the curtain, the bearers lifted the carriage and carried it to a spot where they put it down and harnessed a docile mule to it. Then they left by the west side gate, proceeded east past the main entrance of the Rong Mansion, and entered a gate painted black. They alighted at an inner gate and the servants withdrew, after which the curtain was raised and Lady Xing, taking Daiyu by the hand, led her into the courtyard.

Daiyu guessed that these buildings with their neat halls and corridors must be the Rong Mansion’s garden which she had heard was cut in two. They passed through three inner gates before reaching the main reception hall. Its roofs and colonnades, smaller and more delicate than those she had just left, were exquisitely carved and painted; and on either side were covered corridors leading to annexes. From the hall, lamps shed a brilliant light.

As they entered, a maid announced, “Miss Lin is here.”

No sooner had she spoken than someone came laughing out from the inner room. “I’m late in greeting our guest,” she cried.

Daiyu was wondering who this could be — this matron so unlike the ladies of the Zhu household, with her flowered head-dress, rich costume and sparkling jewels. Before she could step forward, Lady Xing introduced her:

“This is your Uncle Lian’s wife.”

Daiyu lost no time in curtseying.

“Please don’t take it amiss,” said Xifeng, for it was she, as she took her hand. “It’s so long since I saw you last, I can’t remember how you look. I’m quite bewildered.”

Daiyu remembered her mother telling her that this aunt, the wife of her second uncle Jia She’s son Lian, came from a family which was related to the Marquis of Jinling. Her maiden name was Wang. Because she had been brought up in her grandfather’s home she had been known in her childhood as Fengge. But Daiyu had to be careful not to offend her by using this name.

“How can you blame me for being slow to greet you, cousin?” she replied. “I’m too ignorant to know how to address you.”

“You don’t know her.” Lady Xing smiled. “She’s the well-known ‘Peppercorn’ in our house, a ‘peppercorn’ from the south.”

“Don’t tease her, madam,” pleaded Daiyu, though she knew this must be Xifeng.

“I’ve been looking forward to this meeting for so long,” said Xifeng, “that I haven’t been able to wait properly on Lady Wang. But today I can see my cousin at last. Not a day passes but I’m reminded of you, cousin, yet I never thought we’d meet so soon. Well, this shows that my constant thinking of you hasn’t been in vain.” She wiped her eyes with a handkerchief.

“How have you been since you left your father, cousin?” she went on. “Is he well? The old lady was worried because you were so young and had no one to look after you on the journey. But now that you’re here, she’ll be able to stop worrying.”

Daiyu had been rather overwhelmed by this volubility, but these last words touched her.

“My father is well, thank you,” she answered. “He was sorry to part with me, but he said the old lady here is the one person who really cares for young people and would be a second mother to me. Besides, he’s not well himself and has given up hope of an official career. So he told me to come. He said I’d be well looked after here and he needn’t worry.”

“Of course you will,” cried Xifeng. “We’re all devoted to the old lady, and she’s the kindest-hearted person in the world. She never stops talking about you. The only thing is, you mustn’t mope or be too homesick. Make yourself at home. If there’s anything you want, just tell me. If any of the maids or old nurses aren’t respectful, just let me know.”

She turned to the servants.

“Have Miss Lin’s luggage and things been brought in? How many attendants did she bring? Hurry up and clear out a couple of rooms where they can rest.”

By now maids had brought in tea and fruit, and Xifeng passed the tea with her own hands.

“Tell the kitchen to prepare a feast this evening for our guest from afar,” she ordered.

“We’ve already made arrangements,” Lady Xing informed her.

Then Xifeng asked, “Has Miss Lin been to see Lady Wang?”

“She went as soon as she had paid her respects to the old lady,” said Lady Xing. “I suppose she’s there now.”

“I was wondering why I hadn’t seen her there,” remarked Xifeng.

As she was speaking, some nurses came in to report, “The curate from the Temple of the Iron Threshold outside the city has come to take orders.”

“Just give him a few dollars to sacrifice to the idols,” said Xifeng to Lady Xing. “And tell him the mistress isn’t well enough to see him today. Let him come again when she’s better.”

Lady Xing passed on these instructions and the nurses assented and left.

During this conversation Daiyu had been wondering when she should go to see her uncle She. Now Lady Xing said to her:

“You’ve just arrived, dear, and must be tired. Why not rest today? Tomorrow I’ll take you to see your uncle.” She ordered a young maid to take Daiyu to see Lady Wang, and Daiyu politely took her leave. Xifeng accompanied her to the corridor, giving some orders on the way to a few nurses. Then she returned to Lady Xing to discuss the arrangements for Daiyu’s attendants.

Following the young maid, Daiyu turned east, passed a ceremonial gate and entered a courtyard running north and south. At the southern end was a triple-gabled building facing north, with a colonnaded passage on either side. In front of this main structure was a small annex. Nurses in the verandah lifted a red carpet portiere as a voice from within called, “Please come in, miss.”

Daiyu entered and found her aunt, Lady Wang, at home. On the couch by the west wall, on a blue satin cover with a brownish back-rest, sat a handsome, pale-faced woman with well-arched eyebrows and bright, expressive eyes. This was her aunt’s niece, Xichun. Daiyu curtseyed to Lady Wang, who caught her in her arms and made her sit on the couch.

“Your uncle is in the library and will be back presently,” said Lady Wang. “It’s a long journey you’ve had and you must be tired.”

She ordered tea.

“Where are the other young ladies?” she asked.

“They’re with the old lady,” answered the nurses. “They heard that a young lady was coming and have gone to the front to meet her.”

As they were speaking, Xichun came in. The nurses announced her and Daiyu rose to curtsey.

“So this is Cousin Lin?” said Xichun, looking her up and down. “She doesn’t look like a granddaughter of the House of Lin. She’s more like a granddaughter of the Jia family.”

“You’ve hit the nail on the head,” said Lady Wang. “I’ve no daughter of my own. She’s just like a daughter to me.”

“Then she’s my cousin,” said Xichun. “But how is it that she’s dressed so simply? She looks like a poor relation.”

“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Lady Wang. “She’s just arrived and is tired. Let her rest.”

She made Daiyu sit down again and asked her about her mother.

As they chatted, a maid announced that the other young ladies were coming. Nurses ushered in three girls. The first was somewhat plump and of medium height. Her cheeks were the texture of newly ripened lichees, her nose as sleek as goose fat. Gentle and demure, she looked very approachable. The second had sloping shoulders and a slender waist. She was tall and slim, with an oval face, well-defined eyebrows and lovely dancing eyes. She seemed elegant and quick-witted with an air of distinction. To look at her was to forget everything vulgar. The third was not yet fully grown and still had the face of a child.

All four girls were dressed in similar tunics and skirts, with similar head-dresses and jewels. Daiyu rose quickly to greet them.

After the exchange of greetings, when they were seated and tea had been served, the nurses asked Daiyu her age and again expressed sympathy for her mother’s death. But Lady Wang said:

“The journey must have tired you. You’d better go and rest now.”

She turned to the nurses.

“See that Miss Lin has everything she needs.”

Daiyu said goodbye and accompanied by Xichun and her three cousins, she went to the Lady Dowager’s quarters. Lady Wang herself saw"
"Lady Xing insisted that she stay for the evening meal. But Dai-yu smiled and said, ""I thank you, aunt, for your kindness, and really shouldn't refuse. But I still have to pay my respects to my second uncle. It would be disrespectful if I delayed. Please excuse me and let me stay another time.""

""Very well then,"" said Lady Xing. She instructed some elderly servants to escort the young lady in her carriage, and Dai-yu took her leave. Lady Xing saw her to the gate, gave the servants some further instructions, and then, after watching the carriage drive off, went back inside."
"As soon as Daiyu entered the Rong Mansion and alighted from the carriage, she was led by the matrons. Turning east, they passed through a gate leading to a corridor running from east to west, then entered a large courtyard behind the ceremonial hall. Inside the main gate, a spacious courtyard was revealed, dominated by a grand main hall with five large rooms. Flanking it were side chambers with deer-head decorations and mountain-view annexes, creating an interconnected and majestic complex, more imposing than Grandmother Jia’s quarters. Daiyu realized that this must be the principal inner residence. A broad, straight path led directly to the main gate.

Upon entering the hall, she looked up and was immediately greeted by a large blue plaque adorned with nine golden dragons, bearing three characters as large as bushel baskets: ""Hall of Embodied Glory."" Below it was a line of smaller characters: ""Dated such-and-such a month and such-and-such a day, bestowed upon the Duke of Rongguo, Jia Yuan,"" followed by the imperial seal: ""Seal of the Imperial Brush Handling Myriad Affairs."" On a large purple sandalwood desk carved with hydra patterns stood a bronze tripod, green with age, about three feet high. Above it hung a large ink-wash painting of a dragon poised for the dawn court audience. On one side was a golden *wei*-shaped ritual vessel, and on the other, a glass bowl. Along the floor stood two rows of sixteen nanmu armchairs. There was also a pair of couplets, inscribed on ebony plaques with silver-inlaid characters, which read:"
"The pearls and gems on the seats outshine the sun and moon;  
The embroidered garments in the hall rival the brilliance of mists and clouds."
"Below, in a line of smaller characters, it read: ""Written with respect by your fellow countryman and younger cousin in the arts, Mu Shi, the hereditary Prince of Dong'an."""
"It was Lady Wang’s custom, since she had taken to living in retirement, to use not the main hall but a three-roomed suite on the east side for resting and receiving visitors. Accordingly the nurses conducted Daiyu to these apartments.

As she entered the room, a large kang under the window was spread with a crimson foreign rug. In the middle were red back-rests and turquoise bolsters, both with dragon-design medallions, and a long greenish yellow mattress also with dragon medallions. At each side stood a low table of foreign lacquer in the shape of plum-blossom. On the left-hand table were a tripod, spoons, chopsticks and an incense container. On the right one, a slender-waisted porcelain vase from the Ru Kiln containing flowers then in season, as well as tea-bowls and a spittoon. Below the kang facing the west wall were four chairs with blue silk cushions and red-cushioned footstools, and on either side were two tables set out with teacups and flower vases. The rest of the room need not be described in detail."
"The elderly nurses invited Daiyu to sit on the kang, where two brocade cushions were placed opposite each other along the edge. Daiyu, considering the seating arrangement, chose not to climb onto the kang and instead took a chair on the east side. The maids in the room promptly served tea. As she sipped her tea, Daiyu observed the maids, noting that their attire, manners, and behavior were indeed distinct from those in other households. Before she had finished her tea, a maid dressed in a red silk-lined jacket and a black satin sleeveless vest with embroidered borders approached and said with a smile, ""Madam requests Miss Lin to come and sit over there."" Upon hearing this, the elderly nurses led Daiyu out to a small three-room main chamber on the eastern corridor."
"Across the kang stood a small kang-table on which were piled books and tea-things. Against the east wall were a back-rest and bolster of blue flowered satin, neither quite new. Lady Wang was seated on a low chair on the west side, on a black felt cover with a back-rest and cushion. She invited her niece to take the seat on the east, which Tai-yu guessed must be Chia Cheng’s place. And now her eye fell on three chairs by the kang, their black covers embroidered with slip-knot flowers. These were not new either. Having settled herself on one of these chairs, she saw her aunt urge her to take the seat on the kang. Not until her aunt had seated herself there did Tai-yu take a low seat next to her.

“Your uncle’s fasting today,” said Lady Wang. “You’ll see him some other time. But there’s one thing I should like to tell you. Your three cousins are excellent girls, and I’m sure you’ll find them easy to get on with when you study or sew together. There’s only one thing I worry about. That’s my dreadful son, the bane of my life, who torments us all in this house like a real devil. He’s gone to a temple today in fulfilment of a vow, but you’ll see what he’s like when he comes back this evening. Just pay no attention to him. None of your cousins dare to provoke him.”"
"Dai-yu had often heard her mother say that her second uncle’s wife had had a son who was born with a piece of jade in his mouth. He was utterly spoilt and, although now in his teens, was so mischievous and hated study so much that he spent all his time in the women’s apartments with the girls. Thanks to his grandmother’s indulgence no one ever dared to correct him. She knew, then, that her aunt must be referring to this same cousin.

“Does aunt mean the boy born with the jade?” she asked with a smile. “Mother often spoke of him. She told me he was one year older than me, his name is Pao-yu, and for all his pranks he’s very good to us girls. But now that I’ve come here, of course I shall be spending all my time with the other girls while my boy cousins live in the outer compounds. Surely I’ve no chance of seeing him?”

“You don’t understand,” replied Lady Wang with a laugh. “He’s not like other boys. Because the old lady’s always doted on him, he’s used to being spoilt with the girls. If they ignore him he keeps fairly quiet though he feels bored. He can always work off his temper by bullying some of his pages. But if the girls give him the least encouragement, he’s so delighted he gets up to all kinds of mischief. That’s why you mustn’t pay any attention to him. One moment he’s all honey-sweet; the next, he’s rude and recalcitrant; and in another minute he’s raving like a lunatic. You can’t take him seriously.”"
"Daiyu assented to all her aunt’s instructions. Then a maid announced that the Lady Dowager was ready for supper. Lady Wang at once took Daiyu by the hand and led her out through the back door, going west along a corridor and through a side gate to a broad road running from north to south. On the south side was a dainty three-roomed annex facing north. On the north side was a large screen wall painted white, behind which was a small door leading to a neat little house.

“That’s where your Cousin Xifeng lives,” Lady Wang told Daiyu with a smile. “So next time you want to see her, this is the place to come. If you lack anything, just let her know.”

Outside the gate some four or five pages, their hair dressed in tufts, were standing at attention.

Lady Wang led Daiyu through an entrance hall running from east to west into the Lady Dowager’s back courtyard."
"Thereupon, they passed through the back door.

Already a crowd of attendants was in waiting. As soon as Lady Wang arrived, tables and chairs were laid out. Li Wan, wife of Jia Zhu, served the rice, Xifeng laid out the chopsticks, and Lady Wang served the soup.

The Lady Dowager was seated alone on a couch at the head of the room, with two empty chairs on each side. Xifeng at once drew Daiyu towards the seat on the left, but she persistently declined until the Lady Dowager explained with a smile:

""Your aunt and your sisters-in-law don't dine here. Besides, you're a guest, so you may as well take that seat.""

Then, after thanking the Lady Dowager, Daiyu sat down. Lady Wang took the seat opposite, while Yingchun and her two cousins asked permission to sit before taking their places: Yingchun first on the right, Tanchun second on the left, and Xichun second on the right. Maids stood by holding fly-whisks, rinsing bowls and napkins, while Li Wan and Xifeng waited on the table. Although many matrons and maids were in attendance in the outer room, not so much as a cough was heard."
"After the meal was eaten in silence, maids brought round tea on small trays. Since Lin Ju-hai had taught his daughter the virtue of frugality and the need to cherish her health, and warned her that after a meal she should let the food settle before drinking tea or she would injure her stomach, Tai-yu had formed different habits from those current in the Jung Mansion. But feeling obliged to fall in with their ways now, she accepted the tea. However, as the maids were now bringing in a basin for rinsing mouths, she rinsed hers out too; then, after washing her hands, more tea was served — this time for drinking.

“You may go,” said the Lady Dowager now. “We shall be able to manage without you.”

Lady Wang at once rose and after exchanging a few remarks went off, taking Hsi-feng and Li Wan with her.

Then the Lady Dowager asked Tai-yu what books she had studied.

“I have just finished the Four Books,” said Tai-yu. “But I am very ignorant.” Then she inquired what the other girls were reading.

“They only know a very few characters, not enough to matter.”"
"Before she had finished speaking, they heard footsteps outside, and a maid came in to announce, ""Baoyu is here!""

Daiyu was wondering what sort of graceless scamp or little dunce Baoyu was and feeling reluctant to meet such a stupid creature when in he walked."
"On his head he wore a cap of red sable, with a golden filigree top; attached to the cap was a headband ornamented with pearls from which two dragons, each grasping a pearl, were fighting for the precious stone. He wore a narrow-sleeved, full-dress robe covered with embroidery, combined with a jacket worked in coloured silks and decorated with a fringed border, and a sash embroidered with flowers. His face was as radiant as the mid-autumn moon, his complexion fresh as spring flowers at dawn. The hair above his temples was as sharply outlined as if it had been cut with a knife. His eyebrows were as black as if painted with ink, his cheeks as red as peach-blossom, his eyes bright as autumn ripples. Even when angry he seemed to smile, and there was warmth in his glance even when he frowned.

Round his neck he had a golden torque in the form of a coiling dragon, and a silk cord of five colours, on which hung a beautiful piece of jade."
"Upon seeing him, Daiyu gave a start and thought, ""How very strange! It’s as if I’d seen him somewhere before. He looks so familiar."" Baoyu paid his respects to the Lady Dowager and at her command went to see his mother.

He returned before long, having changed his clothes. His short hair in small plaits tied with red silk was drawn up on the crown of his head and braided into one thick queue as black and glossy as lacquer, sporting four large pearls attached to golden pendants in the form of the eight precious things. His coat of a flower pattern on a bright red ground was not new, and he still wore the torque, the jade, his amulet and the lucky lock. Below could be glimpsed light green flowered satin trousers, black-dotted stockings with brocade borders, and thick-soled scarlet shoes.

His face seemed as if powdered, his lips rouged; his glance was full of affection, his speech interspersed with smiles. But his natural charm was most clearly seen in his brows, for his feelings were all contained in the corners of his eyes. In appearance he was the picture of splendour, but it remained to be discovered what lay beneath.

As two later poems describe him:

[The poems are omitted in this translation as per the instruction to focus on the narrative part.]"
"For no cause at all he sought sorrow and nursed hatred,
Sometimes seeming like an idiot.
Though he had a splendid exterior
He was, in fact, stuffed with straw.
Addled in his distress, he’d no knowledge of worldly matters,
Stubborn and dense, he turned his back on writings and scholarship.
In his eccentric ways all social rules he flouted,
So people’s censure he ignored."
"Wealth and honour breed discontent;
Poverty and suffering magnify desolation.
Sadly, he squanders his precious time,
Holding no promise for family or state.

The most useless under heaven,
The most unfilial of all time.
Let all young fops and wastrels
Not follow this example!"
"Grandmother Jia smiled. ""Fancy changing your clothes before greeting our visitor. Hurry up now and pay your respects to your cousin.""

Baoyu had already noticed this new cousin, and he deduced that she must be the daughter of his Aunt Lin. He made her a bow."
"Her dusky arched eyebrows were knitted and yet not frowning, her speaking eyes held both merriment and sorrow; her very frailty had charm. Her eyes sparkled with tears, her breath was soft and faint. In repose she was like a lovely flower mirrored in the water; in motion, a pliant willow swaying in the wind. She had more chambers in her heart than the martyred Bi Gan; and suffered a tithe more pain in it than the beautiful Xi Shi."
"After looking her over, Pao-yu said with a smile, ""I've seen this cousin before.""

""That will do, that will do,"" said his grandmother, laughing. ""Now you'll be all the better friends.""

Pao-yu went up to Tai-yu and sat down beside her to subject her to a closer scrutiny.

""Have you done much reading, cousin?"" he asked.

""Not much,"" she said. ""I've only studied for a couple of years and learned a few characters.""

""What is your honorable name?""

Tai-yu told him.

""And your courtesy name?""

""I have none.""

""I'll give you one then,"" he proposed. ""What could be better than Pin-pin?""

""What origin would that have?"" put in Tan-chun.

""In the Compendium of Men and Objects Old and New it's written that the Western tribe has a stone called tai which can be used instead of graphite for painting eyebrows. As Cousin Lin's eyebrows look half knit, what could be more apt than these two characters?""

""I'm afraid that's your own invention,"" teased Tan-chun.

""Most works, apart from the Four Books, are made up; why not this too?"" he retorted. ""How about you, cousin,"" he went on, ""have you got a jade like mine?""

As the rest of the party had no idea what he meant, Tai-yu at once supposed that he had his own jade in mind.

""No,"" she answered. ""That jade of yours is a rare object, and not everybody can have one."""
"Upon hearing this, Baoyu immediately flew into one of his mad fits. Snatching the jade from his neck, he flung it desperately on the floor.

“Rubbish, rubbish!” he stormed. “What’s so wonderful about it? How can it tell high rank from low? How can it distinguish the wise from the fool? I don’t want this nasty thing!”

The maids serving at table were so shocked that they fell on their knees to pick up the jade. The Lady Dowager caught Baoyu in her arms.

“You wicked monster!” she scolded. “Lose your temper with someone if you like, but why throw away that precious thing your life depends on?”

His face stained with tears, Baoyu sobbed, “None of the girls here has one, only me. What’s the fun of that? Even this newly arrived cousin who’s lovely as a fairy hasn’t got one either. That shows it’s no good.”

“She did have one once,” the old lady coaxed him. “But because your aunt was so attached to her and couldn’t bear to be parted from her when she died, they had to bury it with her to show your cousin’s filial piety and let your aunt’s spirit have it to look at. That’s why your cousin says she hasn’t one — she doesn’t like to boast about it. How can you compare with her? Now put it on again like a good boy, for fear your mother should be cross.”

She took the jade from one of the maids and put it round his neck herself. And Baoyu, reflecting that this sounded reasonable, let the matter drop."
"Just then the nurses came to ask where Daiyu was to sleep.

“Move Bao-yu out of here to sleep with me in the inner room of my apartment,” said Grandmother Jia. “You can put your Miss Lin in the green muslin summer-bed for the time being. We can get another place ready for them when the spring comes.”

“Dear Ancestress!” Bao-yu protested. “I should be perfectly all right in that bed outside the green muslin cover. There is no need to move me out and disturb your peace.”

Grandmother Jia gave the matter her consideration.

“Very well,” she said. “We’ll leave it at that for the present.”

Each of the two children was to have a nurse and a maid in attendance on them at night, while the other servants were to sleep outside in the adjoining room on call. Xi-feng, as we have already seen, had sent across a lilac-coloured flowered curtain and various bedding covers of brocaded satin."
"Daiyu had brought only two attendants with her from home: her old wet-nurse, Nanny Wang, and a ten-year-old maid called Xueyan who had grown up with her and shared her bedroom since she was a child. The Lady Dowager considered Xueyan too young and childish to be of much use and Nanny Wang too old to be very efficient, so she gave Daiyu one of her own maids, a maid of the second grade called Yingge. In addition to these, like the other girls, she was given four other nurses to advise her on deportment and to wait on her, two maids to dress her, do her hair and see to her toilet, and four or five maids for doing the heavier work of sweeping and washing.

For the time being, while she was staying with Grandmother Jia, Yingge and Nanny Wang would sleep in the same room as Daiyu on the curtained kang, and Li Mama (Nanny Li, as we shall call her), the wet-nurse who had suckled Bao-yu, would sleep outside on the larger, curtained bed at the other end of the room with his chief maid, Xiren."
"It so happened that Xiren had originally been the Dowager’s servant, one of the girls like Faithful and Scribe whose names are all borrowed from the names of jewellery. Her real name was Pearl. The Dowager, being devoted to Baoyu and fearful that the maids who waited on him might prove inadequate, had picked out Pearl, impressed by her gentle, sympathetic disposition, and seconded her to Baoyu’s apartment to look after him more personally. Baoyu knew that her surname was Hua, and remembering a line about the ‘flower’s breath assailed men’ in a poem he had once been reading, he asked his grandmother’s permission to change Pearl’s name to ‘Xiren’. Xiren’s devotion to her mistress was absolute. While she was in attendance on the Dowager, she had eyes for no one but the Dowager; and now that she was in attendance on Baoyu, she had eyes for Baoyu only. Unfortunately Baoyu’s character was so peculiar that her devotion often went unappreciated. Indeed, there were occasions when she was sorely tempted to speak her mind."
"That evening, after Baoyu and Nanny Li had gone to bed, Xiren noticed that Daiyu and her maid Yingge were still up. Having taken off her jewellery and changed her clothes, she slipped in and asked with a smile, “Why aren’t you in bed yet, miss?”

“Sit down, sister,” Daiyu invited.

Xiren sat on the edge of the bed.

“Miss Lin has been fretting here all alone,” said Yingge. “She’s been in tears because she says today she’d only just arrived and nearly got your young master’s jade smashed. ‘If it had been broken,’ she said, ‘it would have been all my fault.’ I’ve had ever such a job comforting her.”

“Don’t take it so to heart,” said Xiren. “I’m afraid you’ll see much stranger goings-on here in future. If you take this so much to heart, you’ll never have any peace. Don’t be so sensitive.”

“I’ll remember what you’ve said,” promised Daiyu. “But can you tell me where that jade comes from and what the inscription on it means?”

“Not a soul in the whole house can explain it,” said Xiren. “It’s a strange thing, with a hole ready made in it. They say it came into the world with him, that he had it in his mouth when he was born. Wait, I’ll fetch it for you to have a good look at.”

“Don’t trouble,” said Daiyu quickly. “It’s too late now. We can look at it tomorrow.”

After a little more conversation they went to bed."
"The next day, after paying her respects to Lady Wang, Daiyu went to her quarters. She found Lady Wang and Xifeng together reading a letter from Jinling and discussing it with two messengers sent by Lady Wang’s brother.

Although Daiyu had no idea what this was about, Tanchun and the others knew that they were discussing the case of Xue Pan, the son of Aunt Xue, their Lady Wang’s sister in Jinling. This young man, relying on his wealth and powerful connections, had killed a man and was now being tried in the Yingtian Prefectural Court. It had been reported to Lady Wang’s brother, Wang Ziteng, who had sent them this news, hoping that his sister would invite their relatives to the capital."
