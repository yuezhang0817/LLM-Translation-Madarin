"The troop ascended the riverbank and lined up in a row, bathed in the light of the red sun that had just struggled free from the fog. Like everyone else, my father’s face was half red and half green as they all gazed at the lingering mist over the Ink River, shrouded in the glow of the setting sun. Connecting the roads north and south of the river was a fourteen-arch stone bridge spanning the Ink River. To the west of the stone bridge stood the original wooden bridge, its deck long broken into three or five sections, with a few brown stakes standing stubbornly in the river, helplessly stirring up clusters of pale, frothy waves. The surface of the river, veiled in the dissipating fog, appeared both vivid and grim, evoking a sense of solemn terror. Standing on the riverbank, one could see the endless sorghum fields to the south, their tassels as flat and smooth as a whetstone. They stood utterly still. Each sorghum tassel resembled a deeply flushed, mature face. Together, they formed a powerful collective, embodying a magnanimous idea. My father was still young at the time and could not have conceived of such eloquent words—these thoughts are mine."
Sorghum and humans together await the blossoming of time to bear fruit.
"The highway stretched straight south, growing narrower the farther it went until it was swallowed by the sorghum fields. At its farthest point, where the sorghum merged with the iron-gray edge of the sky, the scene was imbued with the same stirring, poignant grandeur of a sunrise."
"My father watched the dazed guerrilla fighters with a touch of curiosity. Where had they come from? Where were they going? Why had they come to set up an ambush? And what would they do after the ambush was over? In the deep silence, the lapping sounds of water against the broken bridge became more rhythmic and distinct, more crisp and pleasing to the ear. The mist, shattered by sunlight, fell in clumps into the river, whose color shifted from a dark red to a golden red, until it was filled with shimmering light and color. A solitary smartweed, its yellow leaves drooping low, stood by the bank, the once-lavish caterpillar-like tassels now withered and pale, hanging from the crotches of the leaves. It’s crab-hunting season again! Father thought. The autumn wind rises, the weather turns cool, a flock of wild geese flies south… Uncle Arhat said, Go catch ‘em, Little Dou… Go catch ‘em! Delicate crab claws embroidered patterns in the soft mud of the riverbank. Father detected the faint, elegant smell of crabs in the water. Before the war, our family had fertilized our poppies with a mash made of crabs, producing big, colorful blooms and a breathtaking fragrance."
"Commander Yu ordered, ""Everyone, get off the embankment and take cover. Mute, set up the rake."""
"The mute man unwound several loops of wire from his shoulder and bound the four harrows together. He let out a couple of inarticulate sounds, signaling to a few team members to carry the connected harrows to the junction where the road met the stone bridge."
"Commander Yu ordered, ""Men, take cover. Wait until the enemy trucks are on the bridge and Cold Detachment has blocked their retreat. At my signal, open fire together and drive these beasts into the river to feed the eels and crabs."""
"Commander Yu gestured to the mute, who nodded and took half the men and guns to set up an ambush in the sorghum field west of the road. Wang Wenyi started to follow the mute westward but was shoved back. Commander Yu said, ""Stay here with me. Are you scared?"""
"Wang Wenyi nodded repeatedly and said, ""I'm not afraid... I'm not afraid..."""
"Commander Yu ordered the Fang brothers to set up the large swivel gun on the riverbank. He then said to Liu, the musician, who was holding a large suona horn, ""Old Liu, once the battle starts, forget everything else and blow that horn with all your might. The Japs are afraid of loud instruments, you hear me?"""
"Liu the Trumpeter was an early companion of Commander Yu. Back then, the commander was a sedan carrier, while Liu was a musician, gripping his trumpet with both hands as if it were a rifle."
"Commander Yu addressed the men: ""Let me make this clear upfront: if anyone chickens out when the time comes, I’ll shoot him. We’ve got to show Cold Detachment what we’re made of. Those bastards think they can intimidate people just by waving their banner. Well, I’m not buying it. They want to reorganize me? I’d rather reorganize them!"""
"The group sat encircled in the sorghum field as Fang Liu took out his tobacco pouch to fill his pipe, then produced a steel and flint to strike a flame. The steel was pitch black, the flint a reddish-brown, resembling cooked chicken liver. The steel struck the flint with a sharp, scraping sound, sending large sparks flying in all directions. One of the larger sparks landed on the sorghum stalk pith held between Fang Liu’s index and ring fingers. He puckered his lips and blew gently, causing a wisp of white smoke to rise from the tinder, which then glowed red. Fang Liu lit his pipe and took a deep drag. Commander Yu let out a sigh, sniffed the air, and said, ""Knock out your pipe. If the Japanese catch a whiff of smoke, won’t they come straight for the bridge?"""
"Fang Liu took two quick puffs, tapped out his pipe, and tucked his tobacco pouch away. Commander Yu ordered, “Everyone, take cover on the slope of the levee. We don’t want to be caught off guard when the Japs show up.”"
"Everyone was a bit tense, lying on the riverbank, clutching their rifles as if facing a formidable enemy. My father lay beside Commander Yu. Commander Yu asked, ""Are you scared?"" My father replied, ""No!"""
"Commander Yu said, ""Well done, you're truly your godfather's son! You'll be my messenger. When the fighting starts, don't leave my side. I'll give you the orders, and you'll pass them on to the west."""
"Father nodded. He gazed enviously at the two pistols tucked in Commander Yu's belt—one large, the other small."
"The larger one is a German-made Mauser pistol, and the smaller one is a French-made Browning pistol. Each of these guns has its own story."
"The father spat out a single word: ""Gun!"""
"Commander Yu asked, ""Do you want a gun?"""
"Father nodded and said, ""Gun."""
"Commander Yu asked, ""Do you know how to use it?"""
"""Yes!"" said Father."
"Commander Yu drew his Browning pistol from his waist and weighed it in his hand. The pistol was old, its blued finish long worn away. He pulled back the slide, and a round-nosed, brass-cased bullet sprang from the magazine. He tossed the bullet into the air, caught it deftly, and then slid it back into the chamber."
"""Here you go!"" Commander Yu said, ""Use it just like I would."""
"Father grabbed the gun. Holding it, he recalled how Commander Yu had used this very gun to shatter a wine cup just two nights before."
"At that time, the crescent moon had just risen, hanging low over the withered branches. Carrying a wine jar and holding a bronze key, my father followed Grandmother’s orders to fetch wine from the distillery. He pushed open the main gate; the courtyard was silent, the mule shed pitch-dark, and the distillery exuded the pungent odor of fermenting grains. Lifting the lid of one vat, he saw his own gaunt face reflected in the clear, calm wine under the starlight and moonlight. With his short eyebrows and thin lips, he thought himself ugly. He submerged the jar into the vat, and the wine gurgled as it filled. When he lifted it out, droplets pattered back into the vat. Changing his mind, he poured the wine from the jar back into the vat. Then he remembered the vat of wine Grandmother had used to wash her bloodied face. Back at home, Grandmother was drinking with Commander Yu and Commander Leng. Both Grandmother and Commander Yu held their liquor well, but Commander Leng was already somewhat drunk. Approaching that particular vat, my father noticed a stone millstone pressing down on the wooden lid. Setting the wine jar aside, he mustered all his strength to heave the millstone aside. It rolled twice on the ground, collided with another wine vat, and cracked a large hole in its side, from which sorghum wine hissed and spurted. Ignoring it, my father lifted the lid of the vat and caught the scent of Uncle Arhat’s blood. He recalled Uncle Arhat’s severed head and his mother’s blood-streaked face. Their faces seemed to emerge endlessly from the wine in the vat. He submerged the jar into the vat, filled it with the blood-tainted wine, and carried it carefully in both hands back to the house."
"On the square table, brightly burning candles lit the scene where Commander Yu and Detachment Leader Leng stood glaring at each other, both breathing heavily. Grandma stood between them, her left hand pressing down on Leng’s revolver, her right hand on Yu’s Browning."
"The father heard Grandma say, ""Even if the deal falls through, goodwill remains. This is no place for knives and guns. If you have the guts, take it out on the Japanese."""
"Commander Yu angrily shouted, ""You bastard, waving the banner of Brigade Commander Wang won't intimidate me. I am the king of this territory. I've been holding my ground for ten years; why should I care about that son of a bitch Wang Dazhao?"""
"Captain Leng gave a cold smile and said, ""Brother Zhan'ao, we're doing this for your own good, and so is Brigade Commander Wang. If you bring your men over to our side, you'll be made a battalion commander. Your arms and pay will be provided by Brigade Commander Wang, which is far better than being a bandit."""
"""Who are the bandits? Who aren't the bandits? Anyone who can fight the Japanese is a great hero of China. Last year, I took out three Japanese sentry posts and got three rifles. Your Cold Detachment isn't a bandit group, so how many Japs have you killed? You haven't even plucked a single hair from a Jap."""
"Captain Leng sat down, took out a cigarette, and lit it."
"Seizing the moment, Father carried the wine jar forward. Grandmother took it, her expression suddenly changing as she shot him a sharp glance. She poured wine into three bowls, filling each to the brim."
"Grandma said, ""This wine contains the blood of Uncle Arhat. If you're a real man, drink it. In two days, we'll take down the Japanese trucks together. After that, you can go your separate ways—each to their own path, with no interference between us."""
Grandma picked up the wine and gulped it down.
Commander Yu raised the wine and downed it in one gulp.
"Captain Leng picked up the wine and drank half a bowl. Setting it down, he said, ""Commander Yu, I can't hold my liquor well, so I must take my leave now!"""
"Grandma held the revolver and asked, ""Shall we shoot?"""
"Commander Yu said angrily, ""Don't beg him. If he won't fight, I will!"""
"Commander Leng said, ""Attack."""
"Grandma let go, and Captain Leng took the revolver, hanging it on his belt."
"Captain Leng had a fair complexion dotted with about a dozen dark pockmarks around his nose. His belt, weighed down by a large loop of bullets and a gun, sagged like a crescent moon."
"Grandma said, ""Zhan'ao, I entrust Douguan to you. You will take him with you the day after tomorrow."""
"Commander Yu looked at my father and asked with a smile, ""Godson, do you have the guts?"""
"Father looked disdainfully at the commander's sturdy, earth-yellow teeth visible between his lips, not saying a word."
"Commander Yu took a wine cup and placed it on top of my father’s head, instructing him to step back and stand still by the door. He then picked up his Browning pistol and walked toward the corner."
"Father watched as Commander Yu took three large, deliberate steps toward the corner. With each step, Grandma’s face grew paler, while a mocking smile curled at the corners of Cold Chief’s lips."
"Commander Yu walked to the corner of the wall, stopped, and suddenly spun around. My father saw his arm raised level, his eyes gleaming with a dark, reddish light. A wisp of white smoke curled from the Browning’s muzzle. A loud explosion sounded above my father’s head, and the wine cup shattered into pieces. A small shard of porcelain fell onto his neck. He shrugged, and the shard slid down to his waistband. My father said nothing. Grandma’s face grew even paler. Commander Leng slumped onto a stool and, after a long pause, finally said, “Incredible marksmanship.”"
"Commander Yu said, ""Good lad!"""
"Father held the Browning pistol, feeling its unusual heaviness."
"Commander Yu said, ""I don’t need to teach you—you know how to fight. Pass my order to the mute and have them get ready!"""
"Father, holding a pistol, made his way through the sorghum field, crossed the road, and approached the mute. The mute sat cross-legged, sharpening a slender waist knife with a glossy green stone. The other team members were scattered around, some sitting, some lying down."
"The father said to the mute, ""Get ready."""
"The mute cast a sidelong glance at Father and continued sharpening his knife. After a while, he tore off a few sorghum leaves to wipe away the stone dust from the blade. Then he plucked a thin blade of grass to test the knife's edge—the grass quietly snapped upon touching the sharp metal."
"The father added, ""Get yourselves ready!"""
The mute sheathed the waist knife and placed it beside him. A ferocious smile spread across his face. He raised a large hand and beckoned to my father.
"""Hmm! Hmm!"" said the mute."
"Father tiptoed forward and stopped a step away from the mute. The mute leaned forward, grabbed the front of Father’s jacket, and gave it a hard yank that threw him into the mute’s arms. He pinched Father’s ear and twisted it until his mouth was pulled to one side. Father responded by jabbing the muzzle of the Browning into the mute’s backbone. So the mute pinched Father’s nose and gave it a violent twist, bringing tears gushing from his eyes. The mute laughed weirdly."
The team members scattered around the mute burst into laughter in unison.
"""Does he look like Commander Yu?"""
"""It was Commander Yu who planted the seed."""
"""Douguan, I miss your mother."""
"""Douguan, I want to eat your mother's two date-stuffed buns."""
"Enraged and embarrassed, the father raised his pistol and pulled the trigger at the one who dared to covet the steamed bun with dates. The Browning clicked, but the bullet failed to fire."
"The man, his face ashen and sallow, sprang up swiftly to snatch the pistol from Father. Enraged, Father lunged at him, kicking and biting in a furious assault."
"The mute stood up, grabbed Father by the neck, and flung him hard. Father’s body sailed through the air, breaking several stalks of sorghum when he landed. He rolled over, scrambled to his feet, and charged the mute, cursing loudly. The mute just grunted. Father, cowed by his ashen face, froze in his tracks. The mute took the Browning, pulled back the bolt, and removed a bullet, which he held between his fingers, carefully examining the firing-pin indentation in its base. He waved it in front of Father, stuffed the pistol into Father’s belt, and patted him on the head."
"""What are you making a fuss about over there?"" Commander Yu asked."
"The father said indignantly, ""They... wanted to sleep with my wife."""
"Commander Yu asked sternly, ""What do you have to say?"""
"Father lifted his arm to wipe his eyes and said, ""I shot him!"""
"""Did you fire the gun?"""
"""The gun didn't fire."" Father handed the golden dud cartridge to Commander Yu."
"Commander Yu took the bullet, examined it, and then tossed it effortlessly. It traced a graceful arc through the air before landing in the river."
"Commander Yu said, ""Well done! Aim your bullets at the Japanese first. Once the Japanese are dealt with, if anyone dares to say they want to sleep with your mother again, shoot them in the lower abdomen. Don’t aim for the head or the chest—remember, aim for the lower abdomen."""
"Father lay beside Commander Yu. To his right were the Fang brothers. The swivel blunderbuss was mounted on the riverbank, its muzzle aimed at the stone bridge and stuffed with a wad of cotton. A fuse protruded from the rear of the gun. Next to Fang Qi lay a piece of tinder made from the stalk of a sorghum plant, one end of which was smoldering. Beside Fang Liu were a gourd filled with gunpowder and a metal box holding the shot."
"On Commander Yu's left was Wang Wen-yi, who was shaking all over, a long-barreled fowling piece clutched in his hands. The white gauze on his wounded ear was stuck fast to the festering skin."
"The sun was already a pole's height above the horizon, its snow-white core edged with a faint ring of red. The river sparkled brightly as a flock of wild ducks flew over the sorghum fields. After circling three times, most of them swooped diagonally into the grassy reeds along the riverbank, while a few landed on the water, drifting with the current. The ducks in the water kept their bodies still, only turning their nimble heads and necks from side to side. Father felt warm all over, his clothes, once damp with dew, now completely dry. After lying there a while longer, he felt a small stone pressing uncomfortably against his chest, so he sat up, his head and chest rising above the embankment. Commander Yu said, ""Get down."" Father reluctantly lay back down. Fang Family's Sixth Son was snoring through his nose. Commander Yu scooped up a clod of dirt and threw it at Fang Six's face. Fang Six sat up in a daze, yawned, and squeezed out two tiny teardrops."
"""Have the Japs come?"" Fang Liu shouted loudly."
"""Fuck your mother!"" Commander Yu cursed. ""No sleeping."""
"Henan and Hebei lay in silence, the broad highway lifelessly nestled among the sorghum fields. The large stone bridge over the river was so magnificent. Endless sorghum stalks faced the higher, brighter sun, their faces flushed crimson, exuding a delicate shyness. Wild ducks by the shallow water, probing for something with their flat bills, created a chorus of quacks and splashes. Father’s gaze lingered on the wild ducks, studying their beautiful feathers and clever eyes. He held the heavy Browning pistol, aiming at the flat backs of the ducks. He was almost ready to pull the trigger. Commander Yu pressed his hand and said, ""You little bastard, what do you think you're doing?"""
"The father grew increasingly restless, yet the highway lay barren and still. The sorghum fields grew even more vividly red."
"""Leng the Pockmark, that son of a bitch! How dare he make a fool of me!"" Commander Yu spat out viciously. All was quiet in Heinan, with no sign of Leng and his troops. Father knew that the intelligence about the Japanese trucks passing through had come from Commander Leng, who had sought to join forces with Commander Yu’s unit because he feared his own men couldn’t handle the enemy alone."
"Father was tense for a while, then gradually relaxed. His gaze was drawn again and again to the wild ducks. He remembered following Uncle Arhat to hunt ducks. Uncle Arhat had a shotgun with a dark red stock and a leather gun strap. That very shotgun was now being held by Wang WenYi."
"Father's eyes were misty with tears, yet not enough to spill over. Just like that day last year. In the warm sunlight, he felt a piercing chill spreading throughout his body."
"Uncle Arhat was captured by the Japanese and their puppet soldiers along with the two mules. Grandma washed the blood from her face in the wine vat. Her face was fragrant with wine, her skin flushed crimson, her eyelids slightly swollen, and the front of her pale moon-white blouse was soaked with wine and blood. She stood beside the vat, gazing at the wine inside, which reflected her face. Father remembered how Grandma dropped to her knees and kowtowed three times to the wine vat. Then she stood up, scooped up a handful of wine with both hands, and drank it. The rosy flush on her face gathered on her cheeks, while her forehead and chin turned deathly pale."
"""Kneel down!"" Grandmother commanded Father. ""Kowtow."""
The father knelt down and kowtowed.
"""Take a sip of wine!"""
The father raised the wine and drank it.
"Threads of blood, like strands of silk, sank vertically to the bottom of the vat. Inside floated a small white cloud, alongside the solemn faces of Grandma and Father. Grandma’s two narrow eyes emitted a scorching light, which Father dared not meet. His heart pounded as he reached out again, scooping up a handful of wine from the vat. The liquid trickled through his fingers, shattering the reflections of the blue sky, the white cloud, and the large and small faces. Father took another sip, and a bloody taste clung stubbornly to his tongue. The threads of blood had all sunk to the bottom, converging into a turbid mass the size of a fist at the center of the vat’s convex base. Father and Grandma stared at it for a long time. Grandma closed the lid, rolled a millstone over from the corner, and with great effort, lifted it to press down on the lid."
"""Don't touch it!"" Grandma said."
"The father gazed at the damp soil in the millstone's grooves and the wriggling gray-green slugs, nodding with a look of alarm."
"That night, Father lay on his small bed, listening to Grandma pacing back and forth in the yard. The rhythmic clatter of her footsteps, mingling with the rustling sorghum in the fields, wove through his chaotic dreams. In his sleep, he heard the calls of our two handsome black mules."
"At dawn, my father woke once. Naked, he ran into the yard to relieve himself and saw my grandmother still standing there, staring blankly at the sky. He called out, ""Mother,"" but she didn’t respond. After finishing, he took her hand and pulled her toward the house. My grandmother turned and followed him inside, her movements weary. No sooner had they entered than a wave of commotion, like a roaring tide, swept in from the southeast, followed immediately by a gunshot. The sound was piercingly sharp, like a sharp blade tearing through crisp silk."
"The spot where Father now lay was once piled with pristine stone slabs and rocks, with mounds of coarse yellow sand heaped on the embankment like rows of massive graves. The sorghum from the early summer of the previous year stood listless and heavy beyond the embankment. The outline of the road, revealed where the sorghum had been crushed by stone rollers, stretched northward into the distance. At that time, the large stone bridge had not yet been built, and the small wooden bridge was worn and scarred by countless footsteps and the iron-shod hooves of mules and horses. The scent of crushed sorghum seedlings, steeped in the night mist, grew even more pungent by dawn. The fields of sorghum seemed to weep. 

Not long after Father and Grandma heard the gunshot, they, along with the village's elderly, weak, women, and children, were herded to this place by Japanese soldiers. The sun had just risen above the sorghum tops as Father and Grandma stood with a crowd of villagers on the west side of the road, south of the river, trampling the remnants of sorghum underfoot. They stared at a massive enclosure, resembling a cattle pen or horse stable, where a group of ragged laborers huddled outside. Later, two puppet soldiers drove these laborers to the west side of the road, close to Father and the others, forming another cluster of people. Before them lay the spot that would later become infamous for tethering mules and horses. 

The people stood there, withered and still, for what felt like an eternity. Finally, they saw a lean-faced Japanese officer approaching from the direction of the tents. He wore two red patches on his shoulders, a long steel sword dragging at his hip, and held the leash of a wolfhound. His hands were clad in white gloves. Behind him, the wolfhound trailed with a vividly red tongue hanging out. Following the dog, two puppet soldiers carried the stiff corpse of a Japanese soldier, while two Japanese soldiers brought up the rear, escorting Uncle Arhat, who was supported by two puppet soldiers, his body battered and bloody. Father pressed closer to Grandma, and she held him tightly."
"The Japanese officer, holding his dog, stopped in a clearing near the mule paddock. Over fifty white birds fluttered up from the Ink River, soaring through the blue sky above the crowd before turning eastward toward the golden sun. Father saw the disheveled, grimy animals in the paddock and spotted our two large black mules lying on the ground. One of the mules was dead, the shovel still tilted upright in its head. Dark blood had stained the shattered sorghum on the ground and the mule’s once-sleek face, leaving everything filthy. The other mule sat on the ground, its bloodied tail sweeping the earth, the thick skin on its flanks trembling with a rustling sound. From its nostrils, which flared open and closed intermittently, came a whistling noise. Father hadn’t realized just how much he loved these two black mules. Grandma sat upright and proud on the mule’s back, with Father nestled in her arms. The mule carried the mother and son, galloping along the dirt road flanked by sorghum fields, its strides so uneven that Father and Grandma were jostled up and down. The mule’s slender legs kicked up a trail of dust. Father squealed with excitement. Scattered farmers stood at the edges of the sorghum fields, leaning on hoes or other farm tools, their faces filled with envy and resentment as they stared at the beautiful, powdered face of the sorghum workshop’s proprietress. One of our large black mules lay dead on the ground, its lips drawn back to reveal a row of long, rectangular white teeth biting into the earth. The other sat, suffering more than if it had died. Father said to Grandma, ""Mother, our mules."" Grandma reached out and covered his mouth."
"The corpse of the Japanese soldier lay before the Japanese officer, who stood holding his sword with a dog at his side. Two puppet soldiers dragged Uncle Arhat, battered and bloodied, toward a tall hitching post. At first, Father didn’t recognize him. What he saw was a human form beaten beyond recognition. Supported by the soldiers, the man’s head lolled from side to side, the dried blood on his scalp resembling a layer of smooth silt deposited on a riverbank, then cracked and wrinkled under the scorching sun. His feet scraped along the ground, tracing twisted patterns in the dirt. The crowd shrank back silently. Father felt Grandma’s hand gripping his shoulder tightly. Everyone seemed to shrink in stature, their faces turning ashen or dark as soil. For a moment, all was so quiet that the panting of the large wolfhound was clearly audible, followed by the Japanese officer letting out a resounding fart. Father watched as the puppet soldiers dragged the human wreck to the tall hitching post and released him, letting him collapse to the ground like a pile of boneless flesh."
"The father exclaimed in surprise, ""Uncle Arhat!"""
Grandma covered Father's mouth again.
"Uncle Arhat slowly shifted beneath the hitching post, first raising his buttocks high to form an arched bridge shape, then kneeling on both knees, pressing his hands against the ground, and lifting his head. His face was swollen to a translucent sheen, his eyes narrowed to two slits, from which two dark green beams of light shot out. Father was directly facing Uncle Arhat and believed he must have seen him. The organs in his chest thumped and clattered violently; he couldn’t tell whether it was terror or rage. He wanted to let out a forceful howl, but his mouth was firmly covered by Grandma’s hand."
"The Japanese officer holding the dog shouted at the crowd for a while, and a Chinese man with a crew cut translated the officer's words for everyone."
"As the translator spoke, my father didn't catch everything. My grandmother had covered his mouth, leaving him dizzy with sparkling lights before his eyes and a buzzing in his ears."
"Two Chinese men in black stripped Uncle Arhat completely naked and tied him to a wooden stake. The Japanese officer waved his hand, and two other men in black roughly escorted Sun Wu—a well-known butcher from our village, also from Northeast Gaomi Township—out of the wooden pen."
"Sun Five was short and stout, with a fleshy belly, a bald head, and a flushed face. His small eyes were set close together on either side of a deeply sunken nose. Trembling, he approached Uncle Arhat, holding a sharp knife in his left hand and a bucket of clean water in his right."
"The interpreter said, ""The Japanese officer says you must peel them properly. If you don't, he'll have the hounds tear you open."""
"Sun Wu nodded repeatedly, his eyelids blinking rapidly. With the knife clenched between his teeth, he lifted a bucket and poured water over Uncle Arhat’s head. The shock of the cold water made Uncle Arhat jerk his head up abruptly, and the bloody water streamed murkily down his face, neck, and all the way to his heels. Another overseer fetched another bucket of water from the river. Sun Wu dipped a ragged cloth into it and wiped Uncle Arhat clean. As he scrubbed, his hips swayed, and he said, ""Elder Brother..."""
"Luo Han said, ""Brother, just stab me and be done with it. I will never forget your kindness, even in the afterlife."""
The Japanese official let out a shout.
"The translation says: ""Hurry up and get started!"""
"Sun Wu’s expression darkened. He reached out with his thick, stubby fingers, pinched the elder’s ear, and said, “Elder brother, I have no choice…”"
"Father watched as Sun Wu’s blade sawed through Uncle Arhat’s ear as though it were a piece of wood. A piercing shriek tore from Uncle Arhat’s throat as a murky yellow stream of urine shot from between his legs. Father’s legs were shaking so badly he could barely stand. A Japanese soldier walked up with a white porcelain plate and stood beside Sun Wu, who laid the thick, fleshy ear on the plate. Then he cut off the other ear and laid it on the plate, too. Father watched the two ears dancing sprightly on the plate; they actually made a tinkling sound as they smacked against the porcelain."
"The Japanese soldier held the porcelain plate, walking slowly past the laborers, past the men, women, and children. Father saw that Uncle Arhat’s ear was pale and beautiful, and the clinking of the porcelain plate grew even more intense."
"The Japanese soldier presented the ear to the Japanese officer, who nodded in acknowledgment. The soldier then placed the porcelain plate beside the body of the fallen Japanese soldier, paused for a moment in silence, and subsequently lifted it again to offer it to the military dog."
"The wolfdog retracted its tongue and sniffed the two ears with its pointed, jet-black nose. It shook its head, let its tongue out again, and sat back on its haunches."
"The interpreter said to Sun Wu, ""Hey, cut again!"""
"Sun Wu was pacing in circles, muttering under his breath. Father noticed his face was glistening with sweat, and his eyes were blinking as rapidly as a pecking chicken."
"Uncle Arhat’s ears bled only a few drops at the base. Once they were gone, his entire head took on a very clean and simple look."
The Japanese officer roared once more.
"The translation says: ""Cut quickly!"""
"Sun Wu bent down, sliced off Uncle Arhat’s male organ in one swift motion, and placed it in the porcelain plate held by the Japanese soldier. The soldier stretched out his arms stiffly, his gaze fixed straight ahead, walking past the crowd like a wooden puppet. Father felt as though Grandmother’s icy fingers were digging deep into the flesh of his shoulder."
The Japanese soldier placed the porcelain plate under the wolfdog's mouth. The wolfdog took a couple of bites and then spat it out.
"Uncle Arhat let out a piercing cry, his gaunt body writhing violently against the hitching post."
"Sun Wu threw down the knife, knelt on the ground, and burst into loud sobs."
"The Japanese officer loosened the leash, and the wolfhound lunged forward, pinning Sun Wu's shoulders with its front paws while baring its sharp fangs in front of his face. Sun Wu lay on the ground, covering his face with his hands."
"The Japanese officer gave a sharp whistle, and the wolfhound, still on its leash, trotted back briskly."
"The interpreter said, ""Quick, peel it!"""
"Sun Wu scrambled to his feet and, knife in hand, staggered over to Uncle Arhat."
"Uncle Arhat swore loudly, and at the sound of his curses, everyone raised their heads high."
"Sun Wu said, ""Big brother... Big brother... Just bear with it a little longer..."""
Uncle Arhat spat a mouthful of bloody phlegm onto Sun Wu's face.
"""Go ahead, damn you, go ahead and peel it!"""
"Sun Wu, wielding his knife, began peeling from the wound on the top of Uncle Arhat’s head, which was turned outward. Each cut made a rustling sound. He worked with meticulous care. Uncle Arhat’s scalp came away, revealing his purplish eyeballs and strips of flesh..."
"Father said to me that after Uncle Arhat’s skin had been flayed, his misshapen mouth still made gurgling sounds, and strings of bright red blood droplets dripped from his purplish scalp. Sun Wu no longer resembled a human; his knife technique was so refined that he had peeled off the skin in one intact piece. After Uncle Arhat was reduced to a core of flesh, the intestines in his belly seemed to stir restlessly, while swarms of verdant flies filled the sky. All the women in the crowd knelt on the ground, their wails shaking the wilderness. That night, a heavy rain fell, washing away all traces of blood from the mule pen, and Uncle Arhat’s body and skin vanished without a trace. The news of his body’s disappearance spread through the village, passing from ten to a hundred, from one generation to the next, eventually becoming a beautiful legend of the Divine Land."
"""If he dares to mess with me, I'll twist his head off and use it as a piss-pot!"" The sun rose higher, shrinking in size and emitting a blinding white light. The dew on the sorghum grew sparse, and flocks of wild ducks flew away, only to be replaced by new ones. The Cold Clique troops had yet to arrive, and aside from the occasional hare darting across, the highway was devoid of life. Later, a furtive red fox made an appearance. After cursing Commander Leng, Commander Yu shouted, ""Hey, everyone, get up. It looks like we've been fooled by that bastard Cold Pocky."""
"The team members had long grown tired of lying prone and were eagerly awaiting the command. At the leader's order, they all scrambled to their feet. Some sat on the riverbank, striking flints to light their cigarettes with a series of clicks, while others stood on the levee, urinating forcefully down the slope."
"After leaping onto the riverbank, Father was still lost in memories of the previous year, haunted by the image of Uncle Arhat’s skinned head swaying incessantly before his eyes. Startled by the sudden appearance of the crowd, wild ducks took flight in unison, only to land again on the riverbank not far away. They waddled unsteadily, their emerald-green and tawny feathers shimmering amidst the grass."
"The mute approached Commander Yu, carrying his waist sword and an old Hanyang rifle. His face was crestfallen, his eyes fixed and vacant. He raised his hand to point at the sun, which was already high in the southeast sky; he lowered it to gesture toward the highway, which lay empty and still. Then, pointing to his stomach, he let out a series of guttural cries, waved his arms, and directed his gestures toward the village. Commander Yu pondered for a moment before calling out to the men on the west side of the road, ""Everyone, over here!"""
The team members crossed the highway and gathered on the riverbank.
"Commander Yu declared, ""Men, if Leng the Pockmarked dares to double-cross us, I'll go and rip his head off! It's not yet noon, so we'll wait a little longer. If the trucks haven't arrived by midday, we'll head straight to Tanjia Hollow and settle the score with Leng the Pockmarked. For now, everyone rest in the sorghum field. I'll send Dou Guan back to hurry along the meal. Dou Guan!"""
Father looked up at Commander Yu.
"Commander Yu said, ""Go home and tell your mother to have someone make griddle cakes. They must be delivered by noon, and your mother should bring them herself."""
"My father nodded, hitched up his pants, and stuck his Browning pistol securely in his waistband. He dashed down the riverbank, ran a short distance north along the highway, and then plunged into the sorghum field, moving swiftly and stealthily toward the northwest. Inside the sorghum, which stretched out like an ocean, he came across several rectangular mule and horse skulls. He kicked one of them, and two short-tailed, furry field mice jumped out. They stared at him briefly, seemingly unperturbed, before scurrying back into the skull. This reminded my father of our two large black mules. Long after the highway was built, whenever the southeast wind blew, the village was still haunted by the pungent stench of death. In the Ink River the year before, dozens of bloated and rotting mule and horse carcasses had been submerged. They lay stranded in the shallow, weed-choked waters near the riverbank, their bellies exposed to the sun. When the bloating reached its peak, the carcasses would burst open, spilling their magnificent intestines like blooming flowers, while dark green fluids slowly drifted away with the river’s current."
