"On the ninth day of the eighth lunar month in 1939, my father, the offspring of a bandit, was just over fourteen years old. He followed the troops of the legendary Commander Yu Zhan'ao, who would later become renowned far and wide, to ambush the enemy's motorcade on the Jiaoping Highway. Grandma, draped in a lined jacket, saw them off to the edge of the village. Commander Yu said, ""Wait here."" So Grandma stopped. She said to my father, ""Douguan, listen to your foster father."" Father remained silent, his eyes fixed on Grandma's tall figure. Breathing in the warm, comforting scent emanating from her lined jacket, he suddenly felt a chill creeping in. He shivered, and his stomach rumbled. Commander Yu patted him on the head and said, ""Let's go, my foster son."""
"The world was a blur of indistinct images shrouded in a haze. The disorderly footsteps of the troops had already faded into the distance. Before my father’s eyes hung a blue-and-white misty curtain that blocked his vision: he could hear the footsteps of the troops but could see neither their shapes nor their shadows. He tightly clutched the hem of Commander Yu’s jacket, his short legs working rapidly. Grandma grew more and more distant, like the receding bank of a river, while the mist surged toward him like an onrushing sea. Clutching Commander Yu was, to him, like hanging on to the gunwale of a boat."
"And so Father flew off toward the headstone, standing bare and tall amid the blood-red sorghum of his homeland. The withered grass on his grave rustled in the wind. One day a naked little boy led a snow-white goat over to the grave. The animal began calmly nibbling the grass on the grave mound, while the boy stood on the headstone and angrily pissed on it. Then he sang out at the top of his lungs:  
The sorghum is red,  
the Japs are here.  
Compatriots, be ready,  
load your rifles and cannon."
"Some say that shepherd boy is me, but I don’t know if it’s true. I once loved Northeast Gaomi Township with all my heart, and I once hated it with all my heart. As I grew older, I diligently studied Marxism and finally came to understand this: Northeast Gaomi Township is undoubtedly the most beautiful and the most repulsive, the most transcendent and the most mundane, the most sacred and the most corrupt, the most heroic and the most despicable place on earth. It is a place where people can drink the most and love the hardest. My elders who live on this land love sorghum and plant vast fields of it every year. In the late autumn of August, endless stretches of sorghum turn into a crimson sea of blood. The sorghum stands tall and magnificent, sorrowful yet enchanting, evoking passionate love. The autumn wind is bleak, the sunlight intense, and plump white clouds drift across the azure sky, casting their purplish-red shadows over the sorghum fields. Teams of dark red figures weave through the sorghum stalks, casting nets day after day, year after year. They killed and looted, yet they served their country with unwavering loyalty. They performed heroic and tragic plays, making us, their unworthy descendants, pale in comparison. Even as we progress, I keenly feel the degeneration of our kind."
"After leaving the village, the troop advanced along a narrow dirt path, their footsteps mingling with the rustling of trampled grass by the roadside. The fog was extraordinarily thick, lively and ever-changing. On my father's face, countless tiny droplets coalesced into larger beads of water, and a lock of his hair clung damply to his scalp. The faint scent of mint wafting from the sorghum fields on either side of the road, along with the bittersweet aroma of the ripening sorghum, was already familiar to him—nothing new or extraordinary. Yet, during this march through the fog, my father caught a novel, reddish-yellow scent, both腥 and sweet. It subtly emerged from beneath the mint and sorghum, stirring within him a deeply buried, distant memory."
"Seven days later, on August 15, the Mid-Autumn Festival, a bright moon rose slowly. The sorghum stood silent and solemn beneath its glow, the tassels bathed in moonlight as if dipped in quicksilver, shimmering with a flowing radiance. Beneath the fragmented moonbeams, my father caught a scent far more intense than anything he could imagine now—a cloying, bloody sweetness. At that time, Commander Yu led him by the hand through the sorghum fields. Over three hundred villagers lay piled together, limbs entangled, their bodies strewn in disarray. The blood they had shed irrigated a vast stretch of sorghum, turning the dark soil beneath into a muddy sludge that made every step laborious. The cloying, bloody sweetness hung suffocatingly in the air. A pack of dogs, drawn by the scent of human flesh, sat among the sorghum stalks, their eyes gleaming fiercely as they stared at Father and Commander Yu. Commander Yu drew his Mauser pistol, and with a flick of his wrist, two of those gleaming dog eyes went dark. Another flick, and two more were extinguished. The pack scattered in a frenzy, retreating to a distance, where they sat howling mournfully, their greedy gazes fixed on the corpses. The cloying sweetness grew even stronger. Commander Yu roared, ""Japanese dogs! Sons of bitches, Japanese!"" He emptied his remaining bullets at the pack until they vanished without a trace. Then he said to my father, ""Let's go, son!"" Old and young, they walked into the depths of the sorghum under the moonlight. That pervasive, cloying sweetness of the fields seeped into my father’s very soul, and in the years to come, amid even more violent and brutal times, that scent of blood and sweetness never left him."
"The sorghum stalks and leaves hissed and rustled in the fog, through which the bright clamor of the Ink River, winding its way across the low-lying plains, flowed slowly—now loud, now soft, now distant, now near. Catching up with the troops, Father could hear the shuffling footsteps and heavy breathing of the men around him. Someone’s rifle butt knocked against another’s. Someone’s foot crushed what sounded like the skull of a dead man. The man in front of Father began to cough, a sound he recognized immediately. That cough reminded him of the man’s large ears, which flushed bright red whenever he was agitated. Those thin, translucent ears, veined and prominent, were Wang Wen Yi’s most striking feature. He was a small man, with a large head that seemed to sink between his hunched shoulders. Father strained his eyes, piercing through the thick fog to see Wang Wen Yi’s oversized head bobbing with each cough. It reminded him of how pitiful that head had looked, trembling and shaking, when Wang Wen Yi was being beaten during training drills. Back then, he had just joined Commander Yu’s forces. During training, Deputy Commander Ren had shouted, “Right face—!” and Wang Wen Yi, stomping his feet cheerfully, turned in utter confusion. Deputy Commander Ren struck him across the backside with a whip, and Wang Wen Yi let out a cry, “My child’s mother!” His face twisted into an expression somewhere between tears and laughter, while the children watching from outside the low wall burst into roaring laughter."
Commander Yu delivered a swift kick to Wang Wenyi's backside.
"""What's with the cough?"""
"""Commander..."" Wang Wenyi suppressed a cough and said, ""My throat is itching..."""
"""Don't cough even if it itches! If you give away our position, I'll have your head!"""
"""Yes, Commander."" Wang Wenyi responded, another bout of coughing escaping his lips."
"Father sensed Commander Yu's hand release its grip on the back of Wang Wen Yi's neck. He also noticed two purple marks left behind, like overripe grapes, and from Wang Wen Yi's frightened, uneasy blue eyes, there flickered a mix of gratitude and grievance."
"Soon, the unit entered the sorghum field. My father instinctively sensed that they were advancing southeast. The dirt path they had just traversed was the only road leading directly from the village to the banks of the Black Water River. By daylight, this narrow dirt path appeared pale green. Originally built from rich, dark soil, it had been trodden upon for so long that the black hue had settled to the bottom. Countless overlapping hoofprints of cattle and sheep, resembling scattered petals, and the semicircular imprints of mules and donkeys dotted the path. Mule and donkey droppings lay like shriveled apples, cow dung resembled worm-eaten wafers, and sheep droppings were scattered about like black beans shaken loose. My father had often walked this road, and later, during his grueling years in a Japanese charcoal kiln, images of this path would frequently flash before his eyes. My father never knew how many romantic tragedies and comedies my grandmother had enacted on this dirt road, but I knew. Nor did he know that on the dark soil, shaded by the sorghum, my grandmother’s smooth, jade-white body had once lain, and I knew that too."
"After turning into the sorghum field, the fog grew even more stagnant, denser in mass, with less sense of flow. As our bodies and the objects we carried brushed against the sorghum stalks, accompanied by the mournful rustling of the plants, large, heavy drops of water began to fall in a soft patter. The droplets were cool and refreshing, with a delightful taste. When my father tilted his head back, a large drop landed squarely in his mouth. He saw the heavy heads of sorghum swaying within the languid mist. The pliable leaves of the sorghum, drenched in dew, brushed against his clothes and cheeks like a saw. The slight stir of the sorghum created brief gusts of wind above his head, while the sound of the Ink River's flowing water grew increasingly loud."
"My father used to swim in the Ink River, and his affinity for water seemed innate. According to my grandmother, he was more drawn to water than to his own mother. By the age of five, he could dive like a little duckling, his pink bottom pointing toward the sky and his feet held high. He knew that the silt at the bottom of the Ink River was jet-black and glossy, soft as grease. Along the damp banks grew clusters of gray-green reeds and goose-green plantains, along with wild kudzu vines creeping close to the ground and upright clusters of elderberry plants. The muddy shores were imprinted with the delicate tracks of crabs.

When the autumn wind rose and the weather turned cool, flocks of wild geese would fly south, sometimes forming a single line, sometimes a ""V"" shape, and so on. As the sorghum reddened and the west wind whispered, the crabs grew restless. Troops of them, each the size of a horse’s hoof, would crawl onto the riverbanks at night to forage in the grass. Crabs are fond of fresh cow dung and the decaying carcasses of animals.

Listening to the river’s murmur, my father would recall those autumn nights of the past when he followed our longtime hired hand, Uncle Arhat Liu, to catch crabs by the river. The night was the color of gray grapes, the golden wind threaded its way along the river, and the jewel-blue sky stretched boundlessly above, dotted with exceptionally bright green stars. The Big Dipper—the Ladle of the North, governing death; the Southern Dipper—the Winnowing Basket of the South, presiding over life; the Glass Dipper with its eight corners—missing a single tile; the anxious Cowherd ready to hang himself; the sorrowful Weaving Maid poised to leap into the river—all hung suspended overhead.

Uncle Arhat Liu had worked for our family for decades, overseeing the operations of our distillery. My father followed him everywhere, trailing at his heels as if he were his own grandfather."
"In the haze of my father's troubled mind, a lantern with a glass chimney made of four panes flickered to life. Soot from the foreign oil seeped out through the perforated tin lid and the tin cover. The faint light could only pierce the darkness within a radius of five or six meters. The river water, flowing into the lamplight, glowed as warmly yellow as a ripe apricot, but its charm was fleeting, slipping away in an instant. The dark waters mirrored a sky full of stars. Clad in straw rain capes, my father and Uncle Arhat sat beside the lantern, listening to the river's low, mournful murmur—a murmur so deep it seemed to resonate with the earth. From the endless sorghum fields on either side of the riverbank came the excited calls of foxes seeking mates. Drawn by the light, crabs began to gather in the illuminated area. My father and Uncle Arhat sat quietly, reverently attuned to the secret whispers of the world, while the pungent scent of riverbed mud rose in waves. Swarms of crabs encircled them, forming a restless, shifting ring. Anxious and eager to move, my father felt Uncle Arhat's hand press firmly on his shoulder. ""Patience!"" Uncle Arhat said. ""Haste won't let you sip hot gruel."" Suppressing his excitement, my father remained still. The crabs halted as they reached the light, linking head to tail until they covered the ground entirely. Their blue-green shells gleamed, and pairs of stalk-like eyes protruded from sunken sockets. From mouths hidden beneath their slanted faces, they spewed strings of iridescent bubbles. Challenging the humans with their colorful froth, the long bristles of my father's straw cape stood on end. ""Now!"" Uncle Arhat commanded. In an instant, my father sprang up, and together they seized the corners of a finely meshed net that had been laid out earlier, lifting a mass of crabs to reveal the riverbank beneath. Tying the corners and tossing the net aside, they repeated the motion with the same speed and skill. Each haul was heavy, laden with what seemed like thousands upon thousands of crabs."
"After Father followed the troops into the sorghum field, his mind wandered like a scuttling crab, and his feet and legs stumbled through the narrow spaces, knocking the sorghum stalks every which way. His hand never let go of Commander Yu’s coattail; half the time he was walking on his own, and half the time he was being dragged along by Commander Yu. He began to feel drowsy, his neck stiff, his eyes dry and dull. Father thought that as long as he followed Uncle Arhat to the Ink River, he’d never return empty-handed. Father was sick of eating crab, and so was Grandma. It was a case of not wanting to eat it but hating to throw it away, so Uncle Arhat chopped the crabs into pieces with a cleaver, ground them in a bean-curd mill, added salt, filled a crock, and made crab sauce. They ate it all year long. If they couldn’t finish it and it began to stink, they fed it to the poppies. I heard that Grandma smoked opium but never got addicted, which kept her face as pink as a peach and her mind clear and lucid. The poppies they fed the crab paste to grew as big as ball games. The intermingling of pink, red, and white blossoms was a magnificent sight, and their fragrance filled the air. The rich black soil of my hometown produced bountiful crops and a superior people. An uplifting, enterprising spirit—that’s what makes us locals tick. The Ink River yielded a harvest of white eels, as fleshy and succulent as the meat of a young child, with a single bone running from head to tail. They were so stupid they swallowed any hook that came along. The Uncle Arhat Father was thinking about had died the year before on the Jiao-Ping highway. His body had been cut up and scattered here and there. The skin had been peeled from his torso, and the flesh quivered and jumped like a skinned giant frog. Whenever Father thought of Uncle Arhat’s body, his spine tingled. He also recalled an evening seven or eight years earlier, when Grandma, drunk, was in the sorghum winery yard, where a stack of sorghum leaves served as a leaning post. She nestled up against the stack, wrapped her arms around Uncle Arhat’s neck, and said haltingly, “Uncle Arhat . . . don’t go. If not for the monk’s face, then for the Buddha’s. If not for the fish, then for the water. If not for me, then for Douguan. Stay. If you want me . . . I’m yours. . . . You’re like a father to me. . . .” Father remembered how Uncle Arhat had pushed her away and staggered into the mule shed to feed the animals. We raised two big black mules and ran a sorghum winery, which made us the wealthiest family in the village. Uncle Arhat stayed on as foreman of the winery, until the day the Japs led our two big black mules off to work on the Jiao-Ping highway construction project."
"At that moment, from the village left behind by his father and the others, came the drawn-out bray of a donkey. His father’s spirits lifted, and his eyes snapped open, only to see the same semi-solid, translucent mist. The tall, straight stalks of sorghum stood like dense fences, faintly concealed behind the veil of fog, row after row, stretching endlessly into the distance. How long they had been walking through the sorghum field, his father could no longer recall. His mind had long lingered by the distant, roaring, abundant river, lost in memories of the past, so much so that he no longer understood the purpose of their hurried, crowded advance through the dreamlike, ocean-like sorghum field. His father had lost his sense of direction. He had once gotten lost in a sorghum field the year before, but in the end, he had found his way out, guided by the sound of the river. Now, his father listened intently once more for the river’s guidance and soon realized that the troops were advancing east-southeast, heading straight toward the river. With his bearings clear, his father understood: they were setting up an ambush, targeting the Japanese, ready to kill, as if slaughtering dogs. He knew that by continuing southeast, they would soon reach the Jiaoping Highway—a road running north to south, dividing the vast low-lying plain in two and connecting the two county towns of Jiaoxian and Pingdu. This highway had been built by the Japanese and their lackeys, forced upon the common people under the threat of whips and bayonets."
"The restlessness of the sorghum grew more frequent and intense as exhaustion weighed heavily on the people. The accumulated dew fell continuously, drenching everyone’s scalps and necks. Wang Wenyi coughed incessantly, and even repeated scoldings from Commander Yu failed to stop him. Father sensed that the highway was near, his vision blurred and flickered with the shadowy image of the road. Unconsciously, gaps began to appear in the seamless sea of fog, and clusters of sorghum, thoroughly soaked by the dew, gazed mournfully at my father through these misty hollows. Father, in turn, looked back at them with reverence. It suddenly dawned on him that they were living, sentient beings. Rooted in the black soil, nourished by the essence of the sun and moon, and bathed in rain and dew, they possessed knowledge of both the heavens and the earth. From the color of the sorghum, Father deduced that the sun had already set beyond the horizon, igniting the sky into a pitifully vivid red, now obscured by the sorghum."
"Suddenly, a mishap occurred: first, my father heard a sharp whistle by his ear, followed by the sound of something shattering ahead."
"Commander Yu roared, ""Who fired? Son of a bitch, who fired?"""
"The father heard the bullet piercing through the thick fog, slicing through the sorghum leaves and stalks, until one sorghum head fell to the ground. For a moment, everyone held their breath. The bullet continued its shrill cry, disappearing to an unknown destination. The fragrant scent of gunpowder drifted into the mist. Wang Wenyi let out a agonized cry: ""Commander—I’ve lost my head—Commander—I’ve lost my head—"""
"Commander Yu was taken aback for a moment, then kicked Wang Wenyi and said, ""Damn you! How can you talk without a head?"""
"Commander Yu left my father behind and went to the front of the troop. Wang Wenyi was still howling in agony. My father moved closer and saw the bizarre contortions of Wang Wenyi’s face. On his cheek, a stream of deep blue fluid was flowing. My father reached out to touch it, and his hand came into contact with a sticky, scalding liquid. He smelled an odor, reminiscent of the sludge from the Ink River but far fresher and more pungent. It overpowered the faint fragrance of mint, overwhelmed the bittersweet scent of sorghum, and awakened in my father memories that drew ever nearer. Like threading beads on a string, it connected the sludge of the Ink River, the black soil beneath the sorghum, the unending past, and the fleeting present. At times, it seemed as though all things carried the taste of human blood."
"""Uncle,"" my father said, ""Uncle, you're wounded."""
"""Douguan, you're Douguan, right? Can you check if Uncle's head is still attached to his neck?"""
"""Uncle, you're looking fine overall, but your ears are bleeding."""
"Wang Wenyi reached up to touch his ear and found his hand covered in blood. After letting out a sharp cry, he collapsed, exclaiming, ""Commander, I'm hit! I'm hit, I'm hit!"""
"The commander returned from the front, crouched down, grabbed Wang Wenyi by the neck, and whispered sternly, ""Stop yelling, or I'll shoot you!"""
Wang Wenyi dared not shout anymore.
"""Where are you hurt?"" Commander Yu asked."
"""Ears..."" Wang Wenyi sobbed."
"Commander Yu pulled a piece of white cloth resembling a bundle wrapper from his waist, tore it in two with a sharp rip, and handed it to Wang Wen. ""Press this on it for now,"" he said. ""Don't make a sound. Follow along, and we'll bandage it properly once we're on the road."""
"Commander Yu called out again, ""Douguan!"" Father responded, and Commander Yu took his hand and led him away. Wang Wenyi followed behind, groaning and moaning."
"Just then, the big mute who was carrying a rake on his shoulder and clearing the path had stumbled and fallen, causing the rifle on his back to go off. The mute was Commander Yu’s old friend, a hero of the greenwood who had shared kaobing with him in the sorghum fields. An injury to his foot in his mother’s womb had left him with a limp, but he could move with surprising agility. My father was a little afraid of him."
"The heavy fog that had persisted around dawn finally began to disperse just as Commander Yu’s troops reached the Jiaoping Highway. August in my hometown is a season of frequent fog, perhaps due to the low-lying terrain and the dampness of the soil. Once on the highway, my father immediately felt lighter and more agile, his steps swift and steady. He let go of the corner of Commander Yu’s coat that he had been clutching. Wang Wen-yi, his ear wrapped in a white cloth, wore a pained expression. Commander Yu had roughly bandaged his ear, covering nearly half his head in the process. Wang Wen-yi grimaced, his face contorted with pain."
"Commander Yu said, ""You have a remarkably strong fate!"""
"Wang Wenyi said, ""My blood has drained away; I cannot go!"""
"Commander Yu retorted, ""Nonsense! A mosquito bite would hurt more than that. Have you forgotten about your three sons already?"""
"Wang Wenyi lowered his head and muttered, ""I haven't forgotten, I haven't forgotten."""
"He carried a long-barreled bird gun on his back, its stock a blood-red color. A flat iron box for gunpowder hung diagonally at his hip."
"The lingering fog had retreated into the sorghum fields. The road was paved with a layer of coarse sand, untouched by the tracks of cattle or horses, let alone any human footprints. Compared to the dense sorghum on either side, the highway seemed desolate, absurd, and foreboding. Father had long known that Commander Yu’s troops, including the deaf, the mute, the lame, and the crippled, numbered no more than forty. Yet when these men were stationed in the village, they stirred up such chaos, with chickens flying and dogs jumping, that it felt as if the entire village was swarming with soldiers. Now, lined up on the road, the thirty-some men huddled together like a frozen snake. Their weapons were a motley assortment: hunting rifles, fowling pieces, and old Hanyang rifles. The Fang brothers, Sixth and Seventh, carried between them a large pole gun capable of firing small counterweights. The mute shouldered a rectangular iron harrow, used for leveling soil, with twenty-six sharp iron teeth around its edges. Three other soldiers carried identical harrows. At the time, Father had no idea what an ambush entailed, much less why they needed to bring four of these iron-toothed harrows along for the task."
