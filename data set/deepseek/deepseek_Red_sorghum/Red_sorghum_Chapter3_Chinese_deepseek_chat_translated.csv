"Indeed, when the Jiaoping Highway was constructed up to our area, the wild sorghum only reached waist height. Across the seventy-li long and sixty-li wide low-lying dusty plain, aside from a few dozen scattered villages, two intersecting rivers, and the winding paths of country roads, everything was undulating like green waves of sorghum. From our village, the white horse-shaped boulder on the White Horse Mountain to the north of the plain was clearly visible. Farmers weeding the sorghum fields would look up to see the white horse and look down to the black soil, their sweat dripping onto the earth beneath the crops, their hearts filled with sorrow! Rumors had long been circulating that the Japanese were planning to build roads across the plain, leaving the villagers restless and anxiously awaiting the impending disaster."
The Japanese come and go as they please.
"While my father was still asleep, Japanese soldiers and their Chinese collaborators came to our village to press men into labor and to steal mules and horses. He was awakened by the noise coming from our liquor distillery. Holding his hand, my grandmother tottered on her tiny, bamboo-shoot-shaped bound feet as she ran with him into the distillery yard. At the time, a dozen or so large vats, all filled with fine wine whose aroma drifted throughout the village, were arranged in the yard. Two Japanese soldiers in yellow uniforms stood there holding rifles with fixed bayonets. Two Chinese in black uniforms, rifles on their backs, were untying a pair of big black mules from a Chinese catalpa. Uncle Arhat kept lunging at the short collaborator who was untying the animals, only to be driven back by the rifle butt of the tall one. It was early summer, and Uncle Arhat was wearing only a thin shirt. His chest, which was exposed, was a mass of bruises left by the collaborator’s rifle."
"""Fellow warriors,"" Uncle Arhat implored, ""let's talk this over, let's talk this over."""
"The tall puppet soldier said, ""Old beast, get out of the way."""
"Uncle Arhat said, ""This is the landlord's livestock; we can't take it."""
"The puppet soldier said, ""Keep yelling and I'll shoot you, you little bastard!"""
"The Japanese soldier stood with his rifle, as still as a clay idol."
"As soon as my grandmother and my father entered the courtyard, Uncle Arhat said, ""They want to take our mule."""
"Grandma said, ""Sir, we are law-abiding citizens."""
The Japanese soldier squinted at Grandma with a smile.
"The short puppet soldier untied the mule and tugged hard, but the stubborn animal held its head high, refusing to budge. The tall puppet soldier stepped forward and prodded its hindquarters with his rifle. Enraged, the mule kicked up its hooves, and the gleaming horseshoes flung dirt into the soldier's face."
"The tall puppet soldier pulled back the bolt of his rifle, aimed it at Uncle Arhat, and shouted, ""You old fool, you take it—take it to the worksite."""
"Arhat squatted on the ground, silent and unmoving."
"A Japanese soldier, holding his rifle, waved it in front of Uncle Arhat. The Japanese soldier shouted, ""Ulilwala yalali wu!"" Staring at the gleaming bayonet swaying before his eyes, Uncle Arhat slumped to the ground. The soldier thrust the rifle forward, and the sharp edge of the bayonet sliced a white gash across Uncle Arhat's bare scalp."
"Grandma, trembling all over, said, ""Uncle, please... take it to them."""
"A Japanese soldier slowly approached my grandmother. My father noticed that this soldier was a young, handsome lad with large, pitch-black eyes that sparkled brightly. When he smiled, his lips curled back to reveal a set of yellow teeth. Grandma staggered backward, seeking refuge behind Uncle Arhat. Blood was flowing from the gash on Uncle Arhat’s head, staining his hair crimson. Two Japanese soldiers advanced with smirks on their faces. Grandma pressed her palms against Uncle Arhat’s blood-soaked hair, then smeared the blood across her own face. With a frantic motion, she tousled her hair, opened her mouth wide, and began leaping about like a madwoman. Her appearance was three parts human and seven parts demon. The Japanese soldiers halted in astonishment. A short Chinese collaborator soldier remarked, ""Sir, this woman—she has gone completely mad."""
"The Japanese soldier grumbled and fired a shot at my grandmother's head. Sitting on the ground, she began to sob loudly."
"The tall puppet soldier forced Uncle Arhat up at gunpoint. Uncle Arhat took the mule's reins from the short puppet soldier. The mule, head held high and legs trembling, followed Uncle Arhat out of the yard. The street was chaotic with running horses, mules, cattle, and sheep."
"Grandma wasn’t crazy. As soon as the Japanese soldiers and their puppet troops left the yard, she removed the wooden lid from a vat and saw a horrifying, bloody face reflected in the sorghum liquor, whose surface was as smooth as a mirror. Father saw tears flow down Grandma’s cheeks, and as they did, they turned red. She washed her face with the liquor until the entire vat had turned red."
"Uncle Arhat, along with the mules, was taken under guard to the worksite. A stretch of roadbed had already been carved out of the sorghum field. The highway south of the Ink River was nearly completed, and carts of all sizes, loaded down with rocks and gravel, crossed over from the new road and dumped their loads on the southern bank. Only a narrow wooden bridge spanned the river, but the Japanese were planning to replace it with a large stone bridge. Wide swaths of sorghum on both sides of the highway had been trampled flat, covering the ground like a green blanket. On the northern bank, teams of mules and horses were pulling stone rollers up and down both sides of the raised road, which was covered with dark earth, leveling out two large clearings and destroying the tall, closely planted sorghum stalks around the worksite. The animals were led back and forth through the field. Young, tender stalks snapped and fell beneath the animals’ metal-shod hooves, then were pulverized by grooved and ungrooved stone rollers. The rollers, all shapes and sizes, were soon coated with a dark green film of sorghum sap, and the worksite was enveloped in the pungent aroma of the tender young plants."
"Uncle Arhat was driven to transport stones from the south bank to the north bank of the river. Reluctantly, he handed the reins of his mule to an old man with inflamed eyelids. The small wooden bridge swayed precariously, as if it might collapse at any moment. After crossing the bridge and standing on the south bank, Uncle Arhat was lightly prodded on the head with a purplish-red rattan whip by a Chinese man who appeared to be a foreman. ""Go, move stones to the north bank,"" the man said. Uncle Arhat wiped his eyes—blood trickling down from his head had soaked his eyebrows. Carrying a moderately sized stone, he made his way from the south bank to the north bank. The old man who had taken the mule had not yet left, so Uncle Arhat said to him, ""Take good care of them. These two mules belong to my landlord."" The old man hung his head listlessly, leading the mules into the large convoy of livestock clearing the path. The sleek rumps of the black mules glinted with reflected sunlight. Blood still flowed from his head, so Uncle Arhat crouched down, grabbed a handful of dark soil, and pressed it against the wound. A heavy, dull pain radiated from the top of his head down to his ten toes, making him feel as though his skull had split in two."
"At the edge of the worksite, Japanese soldiers and their puppet troops stood sparsely, armed with guns, while foremen wielding rattan sticks drifted around the site like ghosts. Uncle Arhat walked across the site, and the laborers, seeing his head covered in blood and mud, trembled with shock, their eyes wide with disbelief. Uncle Arhat lifted a bridge stone and had taken only a few steps when he felt a sharp, swift gust of air behind him, followed by a long, searing pain across his back. He dropped the stone and saw the foreman grinning at him. Uncle Arhat said, ""Sir, if you have something to say, say it properly. Why resort to hitting me?"""
"The foreman smiled without a word, raised the rattan cane, and struck him horizontally across the waist. Uncle Arhat felt as though this single blow had nearly split him in two. Two streams of scalding tears bulged from the corners of his eyes. Blood rushed to his head, causing the scab of dried blood and dirt on his scalp to throb violently, as if it were about to burst open."
"Uncle Arhat shouted, ""Sir!"""
The officer struck him with the cane again.
"Arhat Uncle asked, ""Sir, why are you hitting me?"""
"The officer shook the rattan in his hand and said with a grin, ""Let me teach you a lesson, you son of a bitch."""
"Uncle Arhat, choking with emotion and his eyes blurred by tears, picked up a large rock from the pile and staggered toward the bridge. His head felt as though it were expanding, and a white film covered his eyes. The sharp edges of the rock dug into his belly and ribs, but he felt no pain."
"The overseer stood still, leaning on his rattan cane as Uncle Arhat passed by him, trembling with fear while carrying a large stone. The overseer struck Uncle Arhat’s neck with another lash of the cane. Stumbling forward, Uncle Arhat fell to his knees, still clutching the stone. The stone crushed his hands, and his chin smashed against it, leaving a bloody, mangled mess. Beaten into a daze, Uncle Arhat began to cry like a confused child. At that moment, a purplish-red flame slowly ignited in his blank, bewildered mind."
"He struggled to pull his hand out from under the stone, stood up, and hunched over halfway, like an old, thin cat bristling with aggression."
"A middle-aged man, around forty years old, approached the supervisor with a broad smile on his face. He pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, selected one, and respectfully offered it to the supervisor's lips. The supervisor opened his mouth to take the cigarette and waited for the man to light it for him."
"The middle-aged man said, ""Sir, there's no need to get angry over such a rotten piece of wood."""
"The overseer exhaled smoke through his nostrils without uttering a word. The elder noticed his nicotine-stained fingers gripping the rattan cane, twisting anxiously."
"The middle-aged man slipped the pack of cigarettes into the foreman's pocket. The foreman seemed completely unaware, grunted, pressed his hand over the pocket, and walked away."
"""Hey, are you new here?"" the middle-aged man asked."
Uncle Arhat said yes.
"He asked, ""Didn't you give him a little gift when you met?"""
"Uncle Arhat said, ""No reasoning, damn it! No reasoning at all. They dragged me here by force."""
"The middle-aged man said, ""You could give him some money or a pack of cigarettes. It's not about rewarding the diligent or punishing the lazy, but about dealing with those who lack awareness."" With that, the middle-aged man strode off to join the group of migrant workers."
"For the entire morning, Uncle Arhat moved stones frantically, as if he’d lost his soul. The scab of blood on his head, baked dry and hard by the sun, ached painfully. His hands were a bloody mess. An injury to the bone in his jaw caused him to drool constantly. The purplish-red flame in his head burned, now strong, now weak, but it never went out."
"At noon, a dusty yellow car came bumping along the barely passable road ahead. He faintly heard a sharp whistle and watched as the listless laborers staggered toward the vehicle. Sitting on the ground, he had no thoughts and no desire to understand what the arrival of the car meant. Only the cluster of crimson flames danced intensely before his eyes, pounding in his ears with a persistent buzz."
"A middle-aged man approached, gave him a hand, and said, ""Come on, old friend, let's go. It's time for dinner. Let's try some Japanese rice!"""
Uncle Arhat stood up and followed the middle-aged man.
"Several large buckets of snow-white rice were unloaded from the truck, along with a large basket filled with blue-patterned white porcelain bowls. A thin Chinese man stood by the buckets, holding a brass ladle, while a plump Chinese man stood by the basket, holding a stack of bowls. For each person who approached, he handed out a bowl, and the brass ladle simultaneously scooped rice into it. The crowd devoured the food ravenously around the truck, all using their hands to eat, as there were no chopsticks."
"The overseer turned around again, holding a rattan cane, that calm smile still on his face. The flames in Uncle Arhat's mind roared to life, illuminating the memories he had cast aside with stark clarity. He recalled the nightmare-like ordeal he had endured for half the day. Armed Japanese soldiers and puppet troops on guard duty also gathered around, eating from a white tin bucket. Behind the bucket sat a wolf dog with a narrow face and cropped ears, its tongue lolling as it watched the laborers."
"Uncle Arhat counted the dozen or so Japanese soldiers and the dozen or so puppet soldiers eating around the bucket, and the idea of running away began to take root in his mind. If he could just make it to the sorghum field, the damned bastards wouldn’t be able to catch him. The soles of his feet grew warm and sweaty. Once the thought of escape had stirred within him, his heart grew restless and anxious. What lay behind the calm, smiling face of the overseer with the cane? Whenever Uncle Arhat saw that smile, his mind went blank."
"The laborers hadn't eaten their fill. The stout Chinese man took back the foreign-style bowls. They licked their lips, gazing longingly at the few grains of rice left in the empty buckets, but no one dared to touch them. From the northern bank of the river, a mule let out a hoarse bray. Uncle Arhat recognized it—it was the bray of our family's black mule. In the newly cleared open space, mules and horses were tethered to stone rollers or millstones. Sorghum lay strewn across the field like corpses. Listlessly, the animals nibbled at the crushed and flattened sorghum stalks and leaves."
"In the afternoon, a young man in his twenties, seizing a moment when the overseer wasn't looking, darted like the wind toward the sorghum field. A bullet caught up with him, and he lay motionless at the edge of the field."
"As the sun dipped towards the west, that dusty yellow car appeared once again. Uncle Arhat had just finished his spoonful of rice. His stomach, accustomed to sorghum meals, fiercely rejected this moldy-smelling white rice. Yet he forced it down, suppressing the spasms in his throat. The urge to escape grew stronger. His thoughts lingered on the courtyard, filled with the aroma of wine, that belonged to him in the village over ten miles away. Since the Japanese had arrived, his fellow brewers had all fled, and the steaming cauldrons for making spirits had gone cold. He thought even more of my grandmother and my father. The warmth my grandmother had given him by the sorghum leaf stack was something he would remember for the rest of his life."
"After dinner, the laborers were herded into a large enclosure made of wooden poles, covered with a few tarpaulins. The cedar poles were bound together with iron wires as thick as mung beans. The gate of the enclosure was welded from iron rods as thick as a finger. The Japanese soldiers and the puppet forces stayed in two separate tents, located several dozen steps away from the enclosure. The dog was tied at the entrance of the Japanese soldiers' tent. At the gate of the enclosure, a tall pole was erected, with two mast lamps hanging from it. The Japanese soldiers and the puppet forces took turns standing guard and patrolling. The mules and horses were all gathered and tied in the sorghum field ruins to the west of the enclosure, where several dozen hitching posts had been set up."
"Inside the fence, the stench was overwhelming. Someone was snoring, while another was urinating into a tin bucket placed in the corner of the enclosure. The sound of urine hitting the metal walls was like pearls falling onto a jade plate. The dim glow of a mast lamp faintly penetrated the fence, and the long shadow of a roving sentry occasionally flickered through the lamplight."
"The night deepened, and a chill permeated the enclosure, making it impossible for Uncle Arhat to sleep. His thoughts still lingered on escape. The footsteps of the sentry echoed around the fence as he patrolled. Lying motionless, Uncle Arhat eventually drifted into a fitful slumber. In his dreams, he felt sharp knives piercing his head and red-hot branding irons clutched in his hands. He woke up drenched in sweat, his trousers soaked with urine. From a distant village came the shrill crow of a rooster. Mules and horses stamped their hooves and snorted. Through the torn tarpaulin above, a few furtive stars peeked in."
"The middle-aged man who had helped Arhat earlier during the day quietly sat up. Despite the darkness, Arhat could still see his eyes, which burned like fiery orbs. Sensing that this man was no ordinary person, Arhat lay still, watching his every move."
"The middle-aged man knelt at the barred gate, slowly raising both arms. Uncle Arhat watched his back and his mysteriously shrouded head. The man gathered his strength, then suddenly twisted to the side, gripping two iron bars as if drawing a bow to shoot an arrow. His eyes emitted a dark green glow that, upon touching objects, seemed to rustle audibly. The two iron bars silently parted. More light from lamps and starlight streamed in through the gate, illuminating someone’s tattered, open-mouthed shoe. The patrol guard turned around. Uncle Arhat saw a dark figure dart out through the bars. The Japanese sentry let out a choked sound before silently collapsing under the iron grip of the middle-aged man. The man picked up the Japanese soldier’s rifle and vanished without a sound."
"Uncle Arhat took a long moment to grasp what had just happened. The middle-aged man turned out to be a hero of extraordinary martial prowess. The hero had cleared a path for him—it was time to run! Uncle Arhat cautiously crawled out through the hole. The dead Japanese soldier lay on his back, one leg still twitching sporadically."
"Uncle Arhat crawled into the sorghum field, straightened up, and made his way along the furrows, carefully avoiding the sorghum stalks to keep from making any noise as he ascended the bank of the Black Water River. The three stars of Orion’s belt were directly overhead; the darkness just before dawn had settled over the land. Stars sparkled in the water of the Black Water River. As he stood cramped on the riverbank, Uncle Arhat felt a bone-deep chill. His teeth chattered incessantly, and the pain from his jawbone spread to his cheeks and ears, merging with the throbbing, festering pain in the top of his head. The crisp, free air, tinged with the juices of sorghum, entered his nostrils, his lungs, and his stomach. The two will-o’-the-wisp mast lights shone through the mist, and the firwood palisade stood there dark and grave, like a gigantic tomb. Uncle Arhat could hardly believe he had escaped so easily. His feet carried him onto the rotting wooden bridge. Fish jumped in the water, the flowing stream gurgled, and a shooting star drew a bright line across a patch of sky. It was as if nothing at all had happened. Nothing. Now all Uncle Arhat had to do was go back to the village, find a place to hide, let his wounds heal, and get on with his life. But as he was crossing the bridge, he heard the raucous bray of a restless mule on the southern bank. For that mule, Uncle Arhat turned back, thus setting the stage for a monumental tragedy."
"The mules and horses were tied to dozens of wooden stakes not far from the fence, the ground beneath them saturated with the pungent smells of urine and dung. Horses snorted, mules gnawed at the stakes; horses chewed on sorghum stalks, mules released loose droppings. Uncle Arhat stumbled forward, pushing his way into the herd of mules and horses. He caught the familiar scent of his family’s two large black mules and spotted their recognizable figures. He lunged forward, hoping to rescue his companions in hardship, but the mules—unreasonable beasts—swiftly turned their hindquarters and kicked out with their hooves. Uncle Arhat muttered, ""Black Mules, Black Mules, let’s escape together!"" The mules, enraged, twisted and turned, fiercely guarding their territory. They no longer recognized their master. Uncle Arhat was unaware that the mix of fresh and old bloodstains on him, along with his new and old wounds, had completely altered his appearance. Distraught, he took a step forward, and one of the mules lashed out with a hoof, striking him squarely on the hip. The old man was flung sideways and landed on the ground, half of his body numb and unresponsive. The mules continued to kick up their hind legs, their horseshoes gleaming like crescent moons. Uncle Arhat’s hip burned and swelled, feeling heavy and cumbersome. He struggled to his feet, only to collapse again, then rose once more. The village rooster, with its thin and reedy crow, called out again. The darkness gradually receded, the Three Stars shone even more brilliantly, illuminating the glistening rumps and eyes of the mules."
"""What a pair of beasts!"""
"Uncle Arhat, burning with rage, stumbled around in search of a weapon. At the worksite where a drainage ditch was being dug, he found a sharp shovel. He walked and cursed without inhibition, forgetting the men and dogs only a hundred paces away. He was free and unfettered, for all inhibitions arise from fear. The red glow in the eastern sky rose and scattered its light as it climbed. The sorghum field just before dawn was so still it felt ready to explode at any moment. Uncle Arhat walked toward the two big black mules under the morning glow. He hated them to the core. The mules stood still. Uncle Arhat leveled the shovel, aimed at one of the black mule’s hind legs, and swung it with all his might. A cold shadow fell upon the mule’s leg. The mule wobbled briefly but quickly steadied itself, letting out a coarse, heroic, shocked, and furious bray from its head. Immediately, the injured mule raised its hindquarters high, splattering a stream of warm blood like raindrops, dripping all over Uncle Arhat’s face. Seizing the moment, Uncle Arhat struck the mule’s other hind leg. The black mule sighed, its hindquarters gradually sinking until it abruptly sat on the ground, its front legs still upright, its neck stretched taut by the reins, its muzzle appealing to the now ash-blue sky. The shovel was pinned under the mule’s heavy hindquarters, and Uncle Arhat was knocked down too. He mustered all his strength to pull the shovel out, feeling its blade firmly lodged in the mule’s leg bone. The other black mule stared dumbfounded at its fallen companion, whinnying as if crying, as if begging for mercy."
"Uncle Arhat held the spade level and moved toward it. The horse strained backward, nearly snapping the halter and cracking the hitching post. Its fist-sized eyes were oozing dark-blue light."
"""Are you scared now, you beast? Where's your arrogance, you beast? You ungrateful wretch, betraying those who trusted you! You damned bastard colluding with foreigners!"""
"Uncle Arhat cursed furiously and shoveled toward the black mule’s long, rectangular face. The shovel bit into the hitching post. He rocked the handle up and down and left and right to free the blade. The black mule struggled, its rear legs arching like drawn bows, its stubby tail scraping noisily across the ground. Uncle Arhat took aim at its face and—whack!—hit the mule square in its broad forehead. The animal’s hard skull sent a shock up the handle and numbed Uncle Arhat’s arms. The black mule didn’t make a sound as it kicked and twisted until it could stand no longer. With a loud thud, it toppled over like a wall. The halter rope snapped; half hung down from the hitching post, the other half lay curled up beside the animal’s face. Uncle Arhat dropped his hands to his sides and stood there gazing at the shiny shovel handle sticking up at an angle from the mule’s head and pointing to the sky. The sun was reddening the sky in the sorghum field to the east, and its rays were trained directly on the gaping black hole of Uncle Arhat’s mouth."
