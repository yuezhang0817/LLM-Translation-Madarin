"In order to document the history of my family, I once returned to Northeast Gaomi Township to conduct extensive research, focusing on that famous battle in which my father had taken part, the one alongside the Black Water River where a Japanese general was killed. A ninety-two-year-old woman in our village said to me: ""Northeast Gaomi, with its masses of humanity, arrayed its forces along the riverbank. Commander Yu stood before the ranks, raised his hand, and cannons roared in succession. The souls of the Japanese soldiers scattered, and they fell one by one on the flatlands. The heroine Dai Fenglian, with her flowerlike countenance, devised a clever stratagem, deploying iron rakes in interlocking rows to block the Japanese advance..."" The old woman’s head was as bald as a pottery jar, her face withered, and the veins on her shriveled hands stood out like the fibers of a loofah. She was a survivor of the massacre that occurred on the Mid-Autumn Festival in 1939. Back then, she couldn’t run because of boils on her feet, so her husband stuffed her into a sweet potato cellar to hide. By sheer luck, she survived. The Dai Fenglian mentioned in the old woman’s clapper ballad was my grandmother’s formal name. Hearing this, I was wildly excited. It meant that the clever tactic of using iron rakes to block the retreat of the Japanese trucks was actually devised by my grandmother, a mere woman. She too ought to be regarded as a pioneer in the War of Resistance and a heroine of the nation."
"Whenever my grandma is mentioned, the old woman has a lot to say. Her words are fragmented and scattered, like a cluster of leaves tumbling in the wind. She talks about my grandma’s feet, which were the smallest in the entire village. She mentions how potent the aftertaste of our family’s sorghum liquor was. When the topic shifts to the Jiao-Ping Highway, her words become more coherent: ""When the road reached our land... the sorghum was waist-high... the Japanese soldiers drove all the able-bodied laborers to work... everyone slacked off and worked half-heartedly... even those two big black mules of your family were taken away... the Japanese built a stone bridge over the Ink River... Luohan, that old hired hand of your family... he and your grandma weren’t exactly innocent, or so people say... oh, your grandma had quite a few romantic escapades in her youth... and your father, so capable, killed someone at just fifteen. A bastard often turns out a hero—nine out of ten of them are fierce... Luohan went to cripple the mules... he was caught and sliced to death piece by piece... the Japanese were brutal, defecating in pots and urinating in basins. That year, when I went to fetch water, what did I pull up? A human head, with a long braid still attached..."""
"Uncle Luo Han was a significant figure in our family's history. As for whether there was an affair between him and my grandmother, it is now impossible to verify. Truth be told, in my heart, I am reluctant to accept it as fact."
"Although I understood the logic, Old Lady Pottery Jar's words still left me feeling embarrassed. I thought to myself: since Uncle Arhat treated my father as if he were his own grandson, then he was like my great-grandfather. If this great-grandfather had actually been involved in a romantic affair with my grandmother, wouldn’t that be considered incest? But this was nothing more than wild speculation. After all, my grandmother was not Uncle Arhat’s daughter-in-law but his employer. The connection between Uncle Arhat and my family was purely economic, not bound by blood. He was like a loyal old family retainer, embellishing our family’s history and, without a doubt, adding luster to it. Whether my grandmother loved him or whether he had ever shared her kang had nothing to do with ethics. So what if she had loved him? I firmly believe that my grandmother was capable of doing anything she set her mind to. She was not only a hero of the Anti-Japanese War but also a pioneer of individual liberation and a model of women’s independence."
"I have consulted the county annals, which record that in the 27th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese army captured a total of 400,000 laborers from Gaomi, Pingdu, and Jiaoxian counties to construct the Jiaoping Highway. Countless crops were destroyed. In the villages along the highway, mules and horses were looted entirely. Farmer Liu Luohan, under the cover of night, sneaked in and used a shovel to injure countless mules and horses by damaging their hooves and legs. He was captured. The next day, the Japanese army publicly executed Liu Luohan by skinning and dismembering him piece by piece at a hitching post. Liu showed no fear, cursing relentlessly until his last breath."
