Editorial: What has China done right to improve its global favorability?
"The American political news website Axios cited a public opinion poll covering 41 countries by the American morning consulting firm, stating that over the past year or so, China's global favorability has been a steadily rising curve, especially after March this year, it has shown an accelerated upward trend. As of the end of May, China's global net favorability was 8.8, while that of the United States was -1.5. This is the first time that China's global favorability has surpassed the United States since the agency started related tracking. This is not an isolated case. In recent years, many international surveys have pointed to the same trend - the world's view of China is becoming increasingly friendly and positive."
"The global goodwill has been enhanced because China has always been a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a maintainer of international order. These efforts and achievements have had a positive impact in the international community. China's development and progress have not only benefited its own people, but also made significant contributions to world peace and development. China's contribution to world economic growth remains around 30%, and its economic growth rate ranks among the top in the world's major economies. More than a decade of jointly building the ""Belt and Road"" has become a visible and tangible change in the lives of countless ordinary people. In Africa, hydropower stations built by Chinese companies have lit up thousands of homes; in Southeast Asia, industrial parks supported by Chinese technology and investment have sprung up. These projects do not attach political conditions, do not engage in ""schoolmaster"" preaching, but sincerely respond to the urgent desire of partner countries to develop the economy and improve people's livelihood. What the world feels is China's inclusiveness and goodwill of ""true development is development for all""."
"From mediating reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, to actively implementing the Paris Agreement, from promoting the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to take effect, to promoting the expansion of the BRICS cooperation mechanism, China has shown the world the image of a responsible major country. Behind this, there is the guidance of advanced concepts and the support of pragmatic actions. Since the proposal of the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative, they have received positive responses and support from more than 100 countries and international regional organizations, injecting valuable stability and positive energy into the complex world. Actively contributing to global development aid projects, promoting political solutions to hot issues, and injecting new impetus into the dialogue of civilizations, China accurately grasps the trend of the times, focuses on the common well-being of all mankind, reflects the common voice of people from all countries seeking peace and development, and has won increasingly widespread global recognition."
"The rise in goodwill towards China also reflects the world's recognition and respect for a confident, self-reliant, justice-upholding, and benevolent major country. Faced with the rising unilateralism and protectionism, China firmly stands on the right side of history, promoting the construction of an open world economy. Faced with hegemonism and power politics, China always upholds justice, presides over fairness, firmly maintains the international order based on international law, and promotes the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction. Meanwhile, a country's good image is also reflected in the continuous enhancement of its soft power. Today, China's cultural creativity is embracing the world with unprecedented vitality. From ""Genshin Impact"" and ""Black Myth: Wukong"" to TikTok and ""Little Red Book"", from the popularity of micro-dramas overseas and the DeepSeek whirlwind to ""China Travel"" and ""Hyperthyroidism Brother"", the ""breakthrough"" effect of these phenomena and products has broken the information cocoon woven by Western media for a long time, showing the world a real China that is full of technology, has a deep historical background, and has a warm and cheerful people."
"The world's goodwill also comes from China's open and inclusive mind and confidence towards the future. China knows well that openness brings progress, while closure inevitably leads to backwardness. We continue to expand the visa-free ""circle of friends"", constantly shorten the negative list for foreign investment access, optimize the business environment, and let global enterprises share the dividends brought by China's development. The latest survey released by HSBC shows that among more than 5700 multinational enterprises in 13 markets around the world, the proportion choosing China as the target market is the highest globally. China's innovative breakthroughs in high-end manufacturing, green energy, and artificial intelligence not only drive its high-quality development, but also contribute the ""Chinese solution"" to solving common challenges of mankind with leading technology and high-quality services."
"The rise in China's global popularity is no coincidence. It is the result of China's decades of hard work and peaceful development; it is the inevitable echo of adhering to consultation, construction, and sharing, and practicing true multilateralism; it is the epochal scroll jointly painted by millions of Chinese enterprises, cultural workers, and ordinary people with sincere cooperation, innovative products, and friendly smiles. This goodwill is an acknowledgment of the Chinese path, an affirmation of China's contribution, and a vivid footnote to the deep-rooted concept of a shared human destiny. It reminds us that the shaping of a great nation's image lies not in aggressive rhetoric, but in subtle, silent practice; not in deliberately created ""personas"", but in persistently ""doing the right thing"". By steadfastly following this path of win-win cooperation and openness, a credible, lovable, and respectable image of China will become clearer and warmer in the hearts of people around the world."
