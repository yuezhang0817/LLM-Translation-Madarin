"Editorial: From Xi'an to Astana, China-Central Asia Cooperation Steadily Advances"
"At the invitation of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Tokayev, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Astana, Kazakhstan from June 16th to 18th to attend the second China-Central Asia Summit. He exchanged views with the leaders of the participating Central Asian countries on the achievements of the China-Central Asia mechanism, mutually beneficial cooperation within the framework, and international and regional hotspot issues, and made top-level designs for the development of China's relations with the five Central Asian countries. This is the first time the China-Central Asia Summit has been held in a Central Asian country, which will ""open the golden age of regional cooperation"" and ""become another milestone in China's cooperation with Central Asian countries"". High praise from the media in Central Asian countries fully demonstrates the sincere expectations of the regional countries for the summit to promote the construction of the China-Central Asia community of shared future."
"China's relations with Central Asian countries have deep historical origins, extensive practical needs, and a solid foundation of public opinion. In May 2023, the first China-Central Asia Summit was held in Xi'an, marking the official launch of the China-Central Asia mechanism and ushering in a new stage in China's relations with Central Asian countries. At the Xi'an Summit, President Xi Jinping proposed ""four persistences"" on how to build a China-Central Asia community of shared future, and ""eight suggestions"" on how to develop cooperation between China and Central Asian countries, pointing out the direction and path for the development of China-Central Asia relations. From Xi'an to Astana, this cooperation axis stretching over 3,000 kilometers not only carries the profound friendship of the millennium Silk Road, but also injects precious certainty into the turbulent and changing world, becoming a model of unity and cooperation among countries in the global south."
"China and Central Asian countries are companions on the road to modernization. Since President Xi Jinping proposed the initiative of jointly building the ""Silk Road Economic Belt"" in Kazakhstan in September 2013, Central Asia has become one of the regions with the most projects under the cooperation framework of the ""Belt and Road"" initiative, with both ""quantity"" and ""quality"" in the bilateral cooperation. In the first five months of this year, China's imports and exports to the five Central Asian countries reached 286.42 billion yuan, an increase of 10.4% year-on-year, setting a new record for the same period in history; the Central Asian natural gas pipeline has delivered more than 500 billion cubic meters of natural gas to China; the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway under construction will give Kyrgyzstan its first access to the sea; the China-Europe freight trains passing through Central Asia have built bridges of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation; a large number of talents familiar with cross-cultural exchanges and mastering emerging engineering technologies have emerged from Confucius Institutes and ""Luban Workshops"". This ""mutual rush"" between China and Central Asian countries is not just a growth curve on the data sheet, but also the smile on the faces of the people of both sides, making the four words ""cooperation and win-win"" have a tangible warmth."
"""Facing global challenges such as unilateralism and protectionism, China and Central Asian countries are confidently demonstrating a model of mutual respect, sustainable development, and win-win cooperation."" The precise summary by Central Asian media encapsulates the core values of cooperation between China and Central Asian countries. Over the past thirty-plus years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China and Central Asian countries have always adhered to the principles of mutual respect, neighborly friendship, joint efforts in the same boat, and win-win cooperation, setting a new model for international relations. When the ""three-coverage"" pattern of comprehensive strategic partnership, the signing of the Belt and Road cooperation documents, and the practice of the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind at the bilateral level are all in place, when global development initiatives, global security initiatives, and global civilization initiatives take root and bear fruit here, the vitality bred by China and Central Asian countries' neighborly, secure, and prosperous cooperation is driving the region to become a garden of hope for win-win cooperation and harmonious coexistence."
"China and Central Asian countries, as countries in the global South, adhere to the practice of genuine multilateralism. Within multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia, China closely cooperates with Central Asian countries. The two sides jointly defend multilateralism, firmly support each other on issues involving their core interests, stand up for each other at critical moments, and safeguard their legitimate rights and strategic interests. This has promoted the democratization of international relations and pushed the international order towards a more just and reasonable direction."
"There is a proverb in Kazakhstan: ""Where there is unity, there is happiness."" When the leaders of the six countries shake hands in Astana again, the second China-Central Asia Summit will surely become a grand event to further consolidate consensus, deepen cooperation, and promote the construction of a closer China-Central Asia community of shared future. China and Central Asian countries, as good neighbors, partners, friends, and brothers, will use greater wisdom and responsibility to push China-Central Asia relations to a new level, making new and greater contributions to regional and even world peace, stability, and prosperity."
