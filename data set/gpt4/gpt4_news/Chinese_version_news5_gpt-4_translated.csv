"Editorial: Washington should not be surprised by China's ""tit-for-tat"" response."
"What exactly has happened between China and the United States? Why has the cooled down trade friction ""reignited"", and how far will both sides go in their ""tit-for-tat"" standoff? This has been a topic of high concern in international public opinion in recent days. Since the Madrid trade talks between China and the United States, the U.S. has continuously introduced a series of restrictions on China, attempting to coerce China through escalating tariff threats and various regulatory actions. After encountering China's firm countermeasures, the U.S. hurriedly ""put out the fire"". This roller coaster-like change once again exposes the arbitrariness and shortsightedness of its trade policy, indicating that Washington has not fully learned its lesson and has not truly understood the correct way to get along with China."
"The sudden change in the trade atmosphere between the two sides is beyond many people's expectations, but it is not surprising. The direct fuse for the escalation of tension in this round of trade relations is the US's untrustworthiness and inconsistency. This is an old problem in Washington. The South China Morning Post said in an editorial that the latest escalation of tension between China and the US can be compared with the tariff war launched by the US in April this year, ""This is a new round of tit-for-tat measures triggered by new US technology restrictions."" The article warns that tariffs may not rise as high as before, but the real damage is that Beijing will think that Washington is no longer reliable and it is harder to believe its promises. CNN also used ""deja vu"" to describe the new friction between China and the US, indicating that it reminds people of the scene where the US threw a series of ""heavy bombs"" after the two countries reached a consensus through the Geneva talks in June, leading to a decline in bilateral relations."
"Washington has been sending out many seemingly contradictory signals during this period. On the one hand, it claims that if China does not submit, it will ""suffer the greatest blow"". On the other hand, it hints at a ""hope to cooperate with China"", which ""largely depends on the actions of the Chinese people"". It seems that the ""cooperation"" some American politicians hope to achieve is: Washington eats and takes for free at the table, while China has to pay out of its own pocket, even ""cutting its own flesh"", allowing the US to take whatever it wants and clean up the mess it leaves behind. Today, some American politicians are shocked, surprised and even angry at China's reasonable and legal countermeasures, which to some extent is due to the shattering of such illusions by the reality that ""China is treating the United States more and more equally""."
"The U.S. side has overestimated the effectiveness of its own bargaining chips, while underestimating China's countermeasures and strategic determination. This cognitive error has directly led to severe real-world backlash. After the U.S. side once again threatened to significantly increase tariffs on China, the U.S. stock and foreign exchange markets fell sharply, triggering global market panic and casting a shadow over the world economy. Its arbitrary actions in areas such as shipping and export controls have not only seriously damaged China's legitimate rights and interests, but also severely disrupted international trade and maritime order, and seriously undermined the security and stability of global production and supply chains. China's ""tit-for-tat"" is not only to defend its own legitimate rights and interests, but also to uphold international fairness and justice."
"Many people have noticed that since this year, every round of extortion launched by the US against China has hit a snag, and unilateral bullying behavior will inevitably lead to China's firm and precise countermeasures. This kind of ""tit-for-tat"" has formed a clear logic: whoever initiates unreasonable suppression must bear the corresponding consequences. As the South China Morning Post said, the US's fickleness and usual tricks do not work on China, and Beijing's position remains the same - any negotiations must be based on equality, respect and mutual trust. Of course, we hope that Washington can actively and timely correct its wrong practices, but if it continues to put extreme pressure on China, fabricate charges, and go back on its word, it will inevitably face the pain of hitting a snag again and again. In this regard, Washington should form highly clear behavioral expectations."
"Over the past more than 5 months, the China-US economic and trade teams have held four rounds of talks, reaching important consensus, stabilizing the bilateral economic and trade relations, and bringing stable expectations to the global market. This process fully proves that China and the US can find solutions to problems based on mutual respect and equal consultation. Reflecting on the lessons learned over the past few months, Washington should recognize the following points: First, the US must respect China's legitimate development interests, which naturally include industrial upgrading and technological development; Second, China's progress does not mean that the US interests will necessarily be harmed, the two countries do have competition in some areas, but the common cake of both sides is much larger; Third, China and the US can fully negotiate on issues of concern to each other, but the result must be win-win, there can be no ""US wins all, China loses all"" realistic solution; Fourth, China does not eat pressure and extortion, the big stick in Washington's hand is nothing more than a paper tiger to the Chinese."
"China has repeatedly emphasized that there are no winners in a tariff war or trade war. Equality, respect, and mutual benefit are the only ways to properly handle differences. China does not want to fight, but it will never sit back and watch its own rights and interests be damaged, and the international economic and trade rules and the multilateral trade system be destroyed. The sooner Washington returns to the right way of dealing with China, the more hope there is for a thaw in Sino-US economic and trade relations."
