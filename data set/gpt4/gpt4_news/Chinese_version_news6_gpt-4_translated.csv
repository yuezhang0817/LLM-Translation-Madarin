"Editorial: The world has never been so eager to understand ""Why China"""
"On October 14th, the Second World Sinology Conference opened in Shanghai. The theme of this conference is ""Historical China and Contemporary China in the World's Perspective"", gathering about 500 guests from more than 50 countries and regions to jointly explore China's history, reality and future. Today, as the process of economic globalization encounters a backlash and the dialogue of civilizations faces challenges, the international community's attention to China is increasing day by day. China's international influence, appeal, and shaping power are also constantly strengthening. The world has never been so eager to understand China."
"In 2023, President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the World Sinology Conference · Shanghai Forum, pointing out that ""Sinology is the study of historical China, as well as contemporary China."" This statement clarifies the profound significance of Sinology, providing an important guide for promoting the exchange and mutual learning of civilizations, and promoting the prosperity and development of Sinology worldwide. The conference set up a main forum and five parallel sub-forums, covering multiple key dimensions of Sinology research, connecting historical China and contemporary China from an academic perspective, reflecting a holistic view of civilization, and conveying China's consciousness and efforts in constructing a subjective knowledge system in the new era to the world."
"The rise of Sinology on a global scale reflects that the world's demand and approach to understanding China are undergoing profound changes. Traditional Sinology mainly focuses on historical China, with literature and ancient civilization as the main research objects. However, Sinology has expanded its research scope from ""historical China"" to ""contemporary China"", from ""China of literature"" to ""China of practice"", and from ""China of others"" to ""China of subjectivity"". Behind this change is the historical change in China's relationship with the world. Today, China is not only an object of academic research, but also a path and method towards modernization. In the profound adjustment of the global pattern today, China has become a country ""as attractive as a magnet"". The rise of Sinology is an important sign of the world rediscovering, understanding, and learning from China. This discovery and understanding are no longer limited to the ""Orientalism"" style of othering gaze, but are based on equal dialogue and mutual learning of civilizations."
"Historically, any global superpower needs to establish its own main body of study to guide its understanding of the outside world. Looking back at world history, Western Europe, Russia, the United States, and others have established their own knowledge systems and constructed their own subjectivity during the process of their rise in modern times. For example, American studies began to develop during World War II and matured in the 1960s, marked by the emergence of modernization theory. With modernization theory as a marker, the United States has its own theoretical framework for self-understanding and expression, and on this basis, it has constructed its own knowledge system."
"The subjectivity of Chinese civilization lies in the fact that China's development experience cannot be simply summarized by the existing Western theoretical framework. To truly understand China, one must deeply grasp the unique genes of Chinese civilization. Historian Toynbee once lamented that among the more than 20 forms of civilization that have emerged in nearly 6000 years of human history, only Chinese culture continues to this day and has never been interrupted. General Secretary Xi Jinping profoundly expounded and summarized the five outstanding characteristics of Chinese civilization - continuity, innovation, unity, inclusiveness, and peacefulness. These interrelated traits are both the key to understanding China and the foundation of China's self-confidence. The practice of the Chinese path to modernization shows that modernization does not mean Westernization, and cultural diversity is the basic form of human development. Only by breaking free from the shackles of a single narrative can we truly understand the constructive significance of China to the world from a pluralistic perspective."
"World Sinology, as a comprehensive discipline that transcends traditional Sinology and regional China studies, its core value lies in reconstructing the global cognitive system of China. This discipline expansion has a distinct practical significance: in the knowledge production system dominated by Western centrism, prejudiced cognition has led to serious misunderstandings - the introduction of the ""Chinese Exclusion Act"" in the United States in the 19th century is directly related to the distorted dissemination of knowledge about China. Today, World Sinology, through interdisciplinary methods and a global perspective, provides an objective framework for the international community to understand China, and is gradually dissolving the cognitive bias brought about by the old ""hegemony-knowledge"" structure."
"As a practice of civilizational dialogue, the World Sinology Conference itself is a vivid manifestation of civilizational exchange and mutual learning. The continuous holding of the conference shows China's determination to integrate into the world and participate in the construction of the global knowledge system with a more open and confident attitude. At the critical crossroads of human development, the open and inclusive dialogue spirit contained in the conference is particularly valuable. Chinese-style modernization has created a new form of human civilization, and is expanding the vast space for the development and progress of human civilization with a completely new form of civilization."
