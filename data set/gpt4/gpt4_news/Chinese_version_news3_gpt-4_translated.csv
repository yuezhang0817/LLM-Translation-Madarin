Editorial: The international community agrees that military force cannot bring peace to the Middle East.
"On the 16th, the conflict between Israel and Iran entered its fourth day, with both sides escalating their confrontations in a tit-for-tat cycle. The mutual attacks not only caused casualties and damage to facilities, but also set a dangerous precedent by targeting nuclear and energy facilities. This has also sparked deep concerns in the international community about the situation spiraling out of control."
"Israel and Iran are important countries in the Middle East, and their relations affect the overall situation in the Middle East. The top priority is to immediately take measures to prevent the escalation of conflicts, prevent the region from falling into greater turmoil, and return to the track of resolving issues through diplomatic means. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has separately called the foreign ministers of Iran and Israel, urging both sides to resolve their differences through dialogue. Relevant parties should immediately take measures to put a brake on the escalation of conflicts and cool down the tense situation. Russia, Germany, France, the UK and other countries have also expressed their willingness to mediate. UN Secretary-General Guterres wrote on social media: ""Israel bombing Iran's nuclear facilities, Iran's missile attack on Tel Aviv, the escalation is enough, it's time to stop, peace and diplomacy must take precedence."""
"It is crucial to fully recognize that only by adhering to the concept of common security can we thoroughly address the reasonable concerns of all parties. Why are extreme pressure and preemption unworkable? The tortuous course of the Iran nuclear issue itself proves this point. On the surface, conflicts arise from ""nuclear"" issues, but essentially, it is another manifestation of the security dilemma. Israel, fearing the threat of Iran developing nuclear weapons, adopts a ""preemptive"" strategy, but its actions infringing on Iran's sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity in turn put it in greater insecurity. In fact, the closest moment to resolving the Iran nuclear issue was not achieved by ""preemption"", but rather through 13 years of ""marathon"" negotiations, with the greatest degree of international community mediation, reaching a binding comprehensive agreement in 2015. If it were not for the subsequent ""breach of contract"" by the United States, if this agreement were fully and seriously implemented, Iran and Israel would obviously be much safer than they are now."
"The ancient Roman scholar Cicero once pointed out: ""Most people think that what is gained from war is more valuable than what is gained in a peaceful environment, but this is wrong."" The late Israeli former president Shimon Peres also expressed a similar view: ""The real victory is to reap peace, not to sow the seeds of another war."" The military conflicts that have taken place in the history of the Middle East have not only failed to end disputes, but have also laid the fuse for more conflicts. The vicious cycle of violence and confrontation is deepening the rift between regional countries, making the road to peaceful resolution of disputes increasingly difficult. In order to get rid of the predicament of bloodshed and turmoil as soon as possible, the Middle East should first abandon the old thinking of ""making use of one's neighbor's difficulties"" within the region, and advocate a new security concept that is common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable. It should be noted that, on the issue of Middle East security, although the positions and concepts of various countries are different, there are still common interests. Only through dialogue rather than confrontation can we narrow down differences and oppositions, and find the greatest common divisor of cooperation."
"As a country with special influence on Israel, the United States should particularly bear the responsibility of a great power in its words and deeds. For a long time, the general impression is that it is difficult for the United States to play a constructive role in easing regional conflicts, but its ability to cause destruction is top-notch. The unending war in the Middle East is not unrelated to the ""visible hand"" of the major powers outside the region. Many analyses believe that the United States' attempt to force Iran to submit by means of ""maximum pressure"" is an important cause of the sudden escalation of the situation between Iran and Israel. In an editorial, the Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao stated that Washington had previously given Iran 60 days to reach a nuclear abandonment negotiation, and Israel just launched an attack on the 61st day, showing the diplomatic tacit understanding of the two sides playing good cop and bad cop. Last year, an article in The New York Times compared the United States to a lion, the ""King of the Middle East Jungle,"" and Iran to a ""parasitic wasp,"" advocating that in order to ""kill the parasitic wasp,"" the United States needs to ""burn the entire jungle."" This kind of thinking is extremely dangerous."
"The security concerns of Middle Eastern countries need to be safeguarded. Military force cannot bring peace to the Middle East, which is a common consensus in the international community, including China. Currently, diplomatic means to the Iranian nuclear issue have not been exhausted, and there is still hope for a peaceful resolution. Most importantly, the conflicting parties and all relevant parties should take immediate measures to create conditions for returning to the right track of dialogue and negotiation to solve the problem."
