"Editorial: Why did this interview with Ren Zhengfei ""go viral""?"
"On June 10th, the front page of People's Daily published an exclusive interview with Huawei's CEO, Ren Zhengfei. When talking about facing external blockades and pressures, Ren Zhengfei said, ""Don't think about difficulties, just do it, step by step."" He also called on the whole society to support theoretical scientific research that ""can only see contributions in decades or even a hundred years"", and to maintain strategic patience with theoretical scientists. As a Chinese entrepreneur, the confidence Ren Zhengfei showed in his words to ""resolutely do his own thing"", the view that ""openness will make us progress more"", and the determination to stick to long-termism at the forefront of technological development, have aroused widespread resonance in society."
"It is well known that Huawei has long been subject to sanctions and suppression from the United States and some other Western countries, from its chips to 5G technology. Not long ago, Huawei's Ascend chip was even unreasonably ""warned"" by the United States about its usage risks. However, Huawei has ""moved forward step by step"", overcoming one difficulty after another. This reflects a value consensus that is increasingly forming in Chinese society. From the semiconductor field, which was once ""choked"", to the most competitive frontiers of technology such as artificial intelligence and basic scientific research, China's leapfrogging progress has never relied on momentary passion, but on long-termism that anchors goals and persists in efforts. It is the persistence in doing the ""difficult but right things"" that gives Huawei the confidence to ""survive"" in the face of suppression and blockade, and to break through in the ""choke point"" areas such as chips and operating systems. This is also a vivid demonstration of ""resolutely doing our own things well""."
"""The more open a country is, the more it will promote our progress."" It should be seen that under the current environment, the development and growth of private enterprises represented by Huawei cannot be separated from the support of China's huge and complete industrial system, infrastructure, talent supply, and institutional guarantees. It also cannot be separated from the construction of the country's market-oriented, rule-of-law, and international business environment. In the past seven years, the central government has held two symposiums for private enterprises, helping enterprises to relieve difficulties, boost confidence, and outline development blueprints. Last month, the ""People's Republic of China Private Economy Promotion Law"" was officially implemented. The 9 chapters and 78 articles continuously optimize the private economic development environment from multiple levels such as fairness, norms, services, and guarantees, creating many ""firsts"". The ""two unswervings"" are written into the law and repeatedly emphasized in the party's documents, giving long-term institutional confidence to private enterprises and entrepreneurs. The resonance of the top-level design of the country and the needs of enterprise development is the most solid support for breaking the blockade and resisting risks."
"The increasing emphasis on R&D investment from all sectors of society over the years also reflects the strong social consensus of ""steadfastly doing our own things"". According to a report released by Huawei's official website in April this year, Huawei's R&D investment in 2024 was 179.7 billion yuan, an increase of 9.1% year-on-year, accounting for 20.8% of sales revenue. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the total amount of research and experimental development (R&D) funds for the whole society in 2024 exceeded 3.6 trillion yuan, reaching 3.613 trillion yuan, an increase of 8.3% over the previous year, and the total investment ranked second in the world. China's R&D intensity reached 2.68%, ranking 12th among the world's major countries, surpassing the average level of 2.11% in EU countries, and further approaching the average level of 2.73% in OECD countries. The World Intellectual Property Organization recently released the ""Global Innovation Index Report 2024"", which shows that China's global innovation ranking has risen by one place to 11th compared to last year, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in innovation over the past decade."
"Many Western media outlets, including Reuters and Bloomberg, have placed this interview in the context of Sino-US competition and ongoing Sino-US trade consultations when they were paying attention to it. Such observation is not surprising, but it somewhat narrows the logic of China's development. Looking solely at the recent development achievements of Chinese enterprises, from DeepSeek to Xiaomi's Xuanjie chip, Huawei's ""pure-blooded"" Hongmeng computer, etc., whether it's breakthroughs in key technologies or cluster-style innovation in multiple fields, they all reflect the combined effect of national strategy and market rules, making society run more efficiently, industries more vibrant, and people's lives more convenient. This is determined by China's national conditions and system. What Ren Zhengfei said, ""One of the purposes of socialism is to develop society,"" is this simple logic. This is also where China's determination and confidence in dealing with various risks and challenges lie."
"""In the new era and new journey, the prospects for the development of the private economy are broad and promising. It is the right time for the vast number of private enterprises and entrepreneurs to show their talents."" General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the symposium on private enterprises has high hopes for private enterprises. As a representative of private entrepreneurs, Ren Zhengfei's statement of ""Don't think about difficulties, just do it"" has gone viral. Behind it is the collective praise of countless people for the spirit of ""love to fight will win"", and the firm confidence in winning the future with struggle. Today's China not only needs to ""do"", but also needs to do with determination, endurance, and direction. In a world full of uncertainty, this kind of long-termism and fighting spirit based on actual work is exactly the confidence for China to weather the storm and move towards revival."
