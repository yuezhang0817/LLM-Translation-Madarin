"In order to commemorate my family, I once ran back to the Northeast Village of Gaomi, conducting a large amount of investigation. The focus of the investigation was this famous battle that my father had participated in, where a Japanese major general was killed by the Ink River. A ninety-two-year-old lady in our village told me: ""In the Northeast Village, there are thousands of people, and the battle formation is lined up by the Ink River. Commander Yu stands in front of the formation, and with a wave of his hand, the sound of cannons is continuous. The souls of the Japanese devils scatter, falling all over the plain. The female leader wears a phoenix lotus, with a beautiful face and clever tactics. She uses an iron rake to block the way, stopping the devils from advancing..."" The old woman's head is bald like a pottery jar, her face is decayed, and her dry hands are bulging with tendons like the insides of a loofah. She is a survivor of the massacre on the Mid-Autumn Festival in August 1939. At that time, she couldn't run because of a sore on her foot, and her husband hid her in a sweet potato cellar, miraculously surviving. The ""Phoenix Lotus"" in the old woman's song is my grandmother's codename. Hearing this, I was extremely excited. This means that the strategy of using an iron rake to block the retreat of the Japanese cars was actually thought of by my grandmother. My grandmother should also be a pioneer of the Anti-Japanese War and a national hero."
"When it comes to my grandmother, the old lady has a lot to say. Her words are fragmented and disordered, like a bunch of leaves rolling around in the wind. She talks about my grandmother's feet, which were the smallest in the village. The aftertaste of our homemade liquor is very strong. When it comes to the Jiaoping Road, her words become coherent: ""When the road was built to our land... the sorghum was waist-deep... the Japanese forced all the able-bodied people to go... to do forced labor, all of them were slacking off... the two big black mules from your house were also taken away... the Japanese built a stone bridge on the Ink River... Luohan, the old long-term worker in your house... he and your grandmother were not quite clear, that's what people say... oh, your grandmother had a lot of affairs when she was young... your father was very capable, he killed people at the age of fifteen, bastards often turn out to be heroes, nine out of ten are not good... Luohan went to shovel the mule's leg... was caught and sliced with a knife... the Japanese were tormenting people, defecating in pots, urinating in basins. That year, when fetching water, what was fetched up, a human head, with a big braid..."""
"Uncle Liu Luohan is an important figure in the history of our family. Whether there was anything between him and my grandmother is now impossible to verify. Admittedly, from the bottom of my heart, I don't want to admit this as a fact."
"Although I understand the logic, the words of the old lady with the pottery jar still make me feel embarrassed. I think, since the old man Luohan treats my father like his own grandson, then he is like my great-grandfather; if this great-grandfather had an affair with my grandmother, wouldn't that be incest? This is actually a wild thought. Because my grandmother is not Luohan's daughter-in-law but his employer, Luohan only has economic ties with my family and no blood ties. He is like a loyal old family member who embellishes the history of my family and undoubtedly adds glory to our family history. Whether my grandmother loved him, whether he had been on my grandmother's kang, it has nothing to do with ethics. What if they loved each other? I firmly believe that my grandmother dares to do anything as long as she wants. She is not only a hero of the anti-Japanese war, but also a pioneer of sexual liberation, and a model of women's independence."
"I have consulted the county annals, which record: In the 27th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese army captured 400,000 times of civilians from Gaomi, Pingdu, and Jiaoxian, and built the Jiaoping Highway. Countless crops were destroyed. The mules and horses in the villages on both sides of the highway were plundered. A farmer named Liu Luohan sneaked in at night and injured countless mules and horses with a shovel, and was captured. The next day, the Japanese army skinned and dismembered Liu Luohan on the horse post for public display. Liu showed no fear, cursing continuously until his death."
