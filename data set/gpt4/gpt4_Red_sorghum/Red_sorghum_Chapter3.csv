"Indeed, when the Jiaoping Highway was built to our place, the sorghum all over the field only grew waist-high. On the low dust hollow plain that is seventy miles long and sixty miles wide, apart from dozens of villages dotted around, two rivers crisscrossing, and dozens of winding country roads, what's waving like green waves is all sorghum. On the White Horse Mountain to the north of the plain, that white horse-shaped boulder can be seen clearly from our village. The farmers who hoe the sorghum see the white horse when they look up, and the black soil when they look down. Sweat drips onto the soil beneath the crops, causing great pain in their hearts! The wind carries the news that the Japanese are going to build a road in the plain, and the villagers have been in a state of anxiety, anxiously waiting for the disaster to come."
Japanese people say they will come and they do.
"When the Japanese devils came to our village with their puppet troops to capture the villagers and take our mules, my father was still asleep. He was awakened by the noise from the distillery. My grandmother, with her small feet like bamboo shoots, ran to the distillery courtyard holding my father's hand. At that time, there were more than a dozen large jars full of high-quality white wine in the courtyard of our distillery, and the aroma of the wine spread throughout the village. Two Japanese in yellow clothes were standing in the courtyard with their bayonet-mounted rifles. Two Chinese in black clothes were about to untie the two big black mules tied to the elm tree. Uncle Luohan repeatedly lunged at the short puppet soldier who was untying the reins, but was repeatedly pushed back by the tall puppet soldier with the barrel of his gun. In the early summer weather, Uncle Luohan was only wearing a single shirt, and his bare chest was covered with purple-red circles poked out by the gun barrel."
"Uncle Luohan said, ""Brothers, let's talk it out, let's talk it out."""
"The tall puppet soldier said, ""Old beast, get out of the way."""
"Uncle Luohan said, ""This is the livestock of the owner, it cannot be pulled."""
"The puppet army said, ""If you make any more noise, I'll kill your little uncle!"""
"Japanese soldiers holding guns, like clay gods."
"As soon as my grandmother and my father entered the yard, Uncle Luohan said, ""They want to take our mule."""
"Grandma said, ""Sir, we are law-abiding citizens."""
The Japanese soldier squinted his eyes and smiled at the grandmother.
"The short pseudo-soldier untied the mule, pulling hard, but the mule stubbornly held its head high, refusing to budge. The tall pseudo-soldier went up and poked the mule's butt with his gun. The mule, in anger, kicked up its hooves, and the bright horseshoes splashed mud onto the pseudo-soldier's face."
"The tall puppet soldier pulled the bolt of his gun, pointed it at Uncle Luohan, and shouted loudly, ""Old bastard, you lead, lead it to the construction site."""
"The old man Luohan squatted on the ground, not saying a word."
"A Japanese soldier, holding a gun, was waving it in front of Uncle Luohan. The enemy said, ""Wu Li Wa La Ya La Li Wu!"" Uncle Luohan, looking at the shiny bayonet waving in front of him, sat down on the ground. The enemy soldier pushed the gun forward, and the sharp blade of the bayonet cut a white mark on Uncle Luohan's bald head."
"The grandmother trembled into a ball, saying, ""Uncle, you, lead them away."""
"A Japanese soldier slowly approached the grandmother. The father saw that this Japanese soldier was a young and handsome lad, with two big eyes shining black, and when he smiled, his lips curled up, revealing a mouthful of yellow teeth. The grandmother stumbled back behind the statue of Arhat. Blood flowed from the white wound on the Arhat's head, staining his entire head. Two Japanese soldiers approached with a smile. The grandmother slapped the blood-stained hair of the Arhat twice, then smeared it on her face, tore her hair apart, opened her mouth wide, and jumped around like crazy. The grandmother looked three parts human and seven parts ghost. The Japanese soldiers stopped in surprise. The short puppet soldier said, ""Master, this woman, she's quite mad."""
The foreign soldier grumbled and fired a shot at my grandmother's head. My grandmother sat on the ground and began to sob.
"The tall puppet soldier forced Uncle Luohan up with a gun. Uncle Luohan took the mule's reins from the short puppet soldier. The mule held its head high, its legs trembling, following Uncle Luohan out of the yard. The street was in chaos with mules, horses, cows, and sheep running around."
"Grandma is not crazy. As soon as the Japanese invaders and the puppet army were discharged from the hospital, Grandma uncovered the wooden lid of a jar. In the calm and mirror-like sorghum liquor, she saw a horrifying bloody face. When Father saw tears flowing down Grandma's cheeks, he turned red. Grandma washed her face with the liquor, turning the entire jar of liquor red."
"Old Luo Han and the mule were taken to the construction site together. In the sorghum field, a section of rut has been opened. The highway on the south side of the Ink River is almost completed, with large and small vehicles squeezing over from the newly repaired road, carrying stones and yellow sand, all unloaded on the south bank of the river. There is only a small wooden bridge on the river, and the Japanese want to build a large stone bridge on the river. On both sides of the highway, two large fields of sorghum have been trampled flat, and the ground looks like it is covered with a layer of green felt. In the sorghum field on the north side of the river, on both sides of the road that has just been shaped with black soil, dozens of mules and horses are pulling rollers, pressing out two large flat areas from the sea-like sorghum field, damaging the green mosquito net tightly connected to the construction site. There are people leading the mules and horses, walking back and forth in the sorghum field. The tender sorghum breaks and falls under the iron hooves, and the fallen and broken sorghum is repeatedly suppressed by the grooved rollers and the non-grooved stone rollers. All kinds of rollers and rollers have turned dark green, and the juice of the sorghum has soaked them. A strong smell of green seedlings envelops the construction site."
"Uncle Luohan was driven to Henan to transport stones to Hebei. He reluctantly handed the mule's reins to an old man with a rotten eye socket. The small wooden bridge was shaky, as if it was about to collapse at any moment. After crossing the bridge and standing in Henan, a Chinese man who looked like a foreman gently prodded Uncle Luohan's head with the purple-red vine in his hand, saying, ""Go, move the stones to Hebei."" Uncle Luohan wiped his eyes - the blood flowing from his head had soaked his eyebrows. He carried a stone of moderate size from Henan to Hebei. The old man who took the mule had not left yet, Uncle Luohan said to him, ""You cherish it, these two mules belong to my master."" The old man numbly hung his head, leading the mule into the mule and horse team that had opened the passage. The black mule's smooth buttocks reflected the sunlight. His head was still bleeding, Uncle Luohan squatted down, grabbed a handful of black soil, and pressed it on the wound. The heavy dull pain on the top of his head went all the way down to his ten toes, he felt his head was split in half."
"On the edge of the construction site, Japanese soldiers and puppet troops with guns stood sparsely, and the overseers with rattan sticks, like ghosts, wandered around the construction site. Uncle Luohan walked on the construction site, and the civilian workers looked at his blood and mud blurred head, their eyes trembling in surprise. Uncle Luohan picked up a bridge stone and had just walked a few steps when he heard a sharp wind behind him, followed by a long burning pain on his back. He dropped the bridge stone and saw the overseer laughing at him. Uncle Luohan said, ""Sir, we can talk nicely, why do you hit people as soon as you raise your hand?"""
"The overseer smiled without a word, raising the rattan and whipping it across his waist again. Uncle Luohan felt as if this rattan had almost split him in half, with two hot tears bulging out from his eye sockets. Blood rushed to his head, and the scab formed by blood and soil was throbbing wildly on his head, as if it was about to burst."
"Uncle Luohan shouted, ""Officer!"""
The officer gave him another rattan stick.
"Uncle Luohan said, ""Officer, why are you hitting me?"""
"The officer, shaking the rattan stick in his hand, said with a grin, ""This will teach you a lesson, you son of a bitch."""
"Grandpa Luohan choked on his anger, his eyes blurred with tears. He picked up a large stone from the pile and staggered towards the small bridge. His head was swelling, and everything in front of him was a blur. The sharp edges of the stone poked his abdomen and ribs, but he could no longer feel the pain."
"The supervisor stood still with a rattan stick, while Uncle Luohan carried the stone, walking past him with fear and trepidation. The supervisor whipped Uncle Luohan's neck with the rattan stick again. Uncle Luohan fell forward, holding the big stone, and knelt on the ground. The stone smashed his hands, and his chin was bruised and bloody from hitting the stone. Uncle Luohan was so beaten that he was at his wits' end, and he started crying like a child. At this moment, a purple-red flame slowly lit up in his blank mind."
"He struggled to pull his hand out from under the stone, stood up, his waist half-bent, like an old, thin cat showing its might."
"A middle-aged man in his early forties, with a full face of smiles, walked up to the foreman, took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, pinched one out, and offered it to the foreman's mouth. The foreman opened his mouth to take the cigarette, and then waited for the man to light it for him."
"The middle-aged man said, ""Sir, it's not worth getting angry with this rotten piece of wood."""
"The supervisor exhaled smoke from his nostrils without uttering a word. The old man noticed his yellowed fingers, tightly gripping the rattan stick, twisting urgently."
"The middle-aged man slipped the box of cigarettes into the foreman's pocket. The foreman seemed completely unaware, grunted, pressed his hand over the pocket, and walked away."
"""Hey bro, you're new here, aren't you?"" the middle-aged man asked."
The translation of the Chinese content is: Uncle Luohan said yes.
"He asked, ""Didn't you give him a meeting gift?"""
"Uncle Luohan said, ""Unreasonable, dog! Unreasonable, they forcibly brought me here."""
"The middle-aged man said, ""Give him some money, or a box of cigarettes, it's all fine. Don't hit the diligent ones, don't hit the lazy ones, only hit those who don't know their place."" The middle-aged man confidently joined the team of migrant workers."
"For a whole morning, Uncle Luo Han was like a soulless man, desperately moving stones. The scab on his head was being baked by the sun, causing a dry and painful sensation. His hands were bloody and mangled. His jawbone was injured, and saliva kept flowing out. The purplish-red flame in his mind was burning, sometimes strong, sometimes weak, but it never went out."
"At noon, a earthy yellow car drove bumpy from the road ahead that was barely passable. He vaguely heard a sharp whistle, and saw the half-dead workers swaying towards the car. He sat on the ground, without any thoughts, and didn't want to know what was going on with the arrival of the car. Only the cluster of purplish-red flames were jumping hotly, buzzing in his ears."
"A middle-aged man came over, pulled him, and said, ""Brother, let's go, it's time to eat, let's try some Oriental rice!"""
The old man named Luohan stood up and followed the middle-aged man.
"Several large buckets of snow-white rice were lifted from the car, along with a large basket holding a blue and white porcelain bowl. A thin Chinese man stood by the bucket, wielding a brass spoon; a fat Chinese man stood by the basket, holding a stack of bowls. When a person came, he would give them a bowl, and the brass spoon would simultaneously scoop rice into this bowl. People around the car were wolfing down the food, without chopsticks, all using their hands to grab."
"The foreman turned around again, holding a rattan stick, his face still wearing that calm smile. The spark in Uncle Luohan's mind flared up suddenly, illuminating the memories he had thrown away clearly, he remembered the nightmare-like experiences of the past half-day. The Japanese soldiers and puppet troops standing guard with guns also gathered around, eating around a white iron bucket. A wolf dog with a long face and cropped ears sat behind the bucket, sticking out its tongue and watching the civilian workers."
"Uncle Luohan counted the dozens of Japanese soldiers and puppet troops eating around the bucket, and a thought of running away sprouted in his heart. Run, as long as he could get into the sorghum field, those damn people wouldn't be able to catch him. Sweat was flowing hotly from the soles of his feet. Ever since the idea of running away came up, his heart has been restless. What was hidden behind the calm smile of the vine supervisor? As soon as Uncle Luohan saw this smile, his mind immediately became confused."
"The coolies hadn't had enough to eat. The fat Chinese man took back the foreign bowls. The coolies licked their lips, staring eagerly at the remaining grains of rice in those empty buckets, but no one dared to touch them. On the bank of the Hebei, a mule began to bray hoarsely. Uncle Luohan recognized it, it was my black mule calling. On that newly cleared land, mules and horses were tied to rollers or stone rollers. Sorghum corpses were scattered all over the field. The mules and horses were listlessly nibbling on the crushed and flattened sorghum stems and leaves."
"In the afternoon, a young man in his twenties, taking advantage of the overseer's inattention, darted towards the sorghum field like a bullet chasing him. He lay motionless on the edge of the sorghum field."
"The sun sets in the west, and that earthy yellow car comes again. Uncle Luohan finished that spoonful of rice. His stomach, accustomed to sorghum rice, was firmly rejecting this moldy white rice. But he still swallowed it down, enduring the convulsion of his throat. The urge to run was getting stronger. He was thinking about the wine-scented courtyard that belonged to him in the village ten miles away. When the Japanese came, his distilling partners all ran away, and the steaming pot of liquor cooled down. He missed my grandmother and my father even more. The warmth my grandmother gave him by the stack of sorghum leaves was unforgettable for him."
"After dinner, the civilians were driven into a large pen made of wooden poles. The pen was covered with several pieces of canvas. The fir poles were all connected by iron wires as thick as green beans. The pen gate was welded with half a bunch of thick iron bars. The enemy soldiers and the puppet troops were divided into two tents, which were dozens of steps away from the pen. The dog was tied at the door of the enemy's tent. At the entrance of the pen, a tall pole was planted, with two mast lamps hanging on it. The enemy soldiers and the puppet troops took turns standing guard and moving. The mules and horses were all concentrated and tied on the ruins of the sorghum field on the west side of the pen. There were dozens of horse-tying stakes planted there."
"The stench is overwhelming inside the fence, with someone snoring, and someone urinating into the iron bucket at the corner of the fence, the urine hitting the bucket wall like pearls falling onto a jade plate. The dim light from the mast lamp seeps through the fence. The long shadow of the patrolling guard sways in the lamp light from time to time."
"The night deepened, and the chill in the fence was biting. Uncle Luo Han couldn't sleep. He still wanted to run. The footsteps of the guard post echoed around the fence. Uncle Luo Han lay still, daring not to move, and somehow fell asleep in a daze. In his dream, he felt a sharp knife on his head and a branding iron in his hand. When he woke up, he was drenched in sweat, and his pants were wet with urine. From a distant village came a sharp crowing of a rooster. Mules and horses stamped their hooves and snorted. On the tattered canvas, a few sneaky stars leaked out."
"The middle-aged man who had helped Grandpa Luohan during the day quietly sat up. Even in the darkness, Grandpa Luohan could still see his two fiery eyes. Grandpa Luohan knew that the middle-aged man was extraordinary, so he lay quietly watching his movements."
"A middle-aged man knelt at the gate of the fence, raising his arms, moving very slowly. Uncle Arhat watched his back, watched his head with mysterious colors. The middle-aged man took a breath and turned his face sharply, like drawing a bow and shooting an arrow, grabbing two iron rods. His eyes shot out dark green light, which seemed to make a rustling sound when it touched an object. The two iron rods opened silently. More lights and starlight shot in from outside the fence, illuminating someone's open-mouthed broken shoe. The moving sentinel turned around. Uncle Arhat saw a shadow flying out of the fence, the enemy sentry chuckled, and then silently fell to the ground with the support of the middle-aged man's iron arm. The middle-aged man picked up the enemy's rifle and quietly disappeared."
"It took Uncle Luohan a good while to understand what had happened before his eyes. The middle-aged man turned out to be a highly skilled hero. The hero had paved the way for him, run! Uncle Luohan carefully crawled out of that hole. The dead devil was lying on his back, with one leg still twitching."
"Uncle Luo Han crawled into the sorghum field, straightened his back, followed the furrow, avoiding the sorghum as much as possible, making no noise, and walked onto the bank of the Ink River. The three stars were in the middle of the sky, and the darkness before dawn descended. The stars in the Ink River were brilliant. Standing cramped on the river bank, Uncle Luo Han was bone-chillingly cold, his teeth chattering frequently, the pain from his jawbone spreading to his cheeks and ears, connecting with the throbbing, pus-like pain on top of his head. The cold air mixed with the juice of the sorghum entered his nostrils, lungs, and stomach. The two ghostly mast lights were on in the fog, and the cedar fence was dark, like a huge tomb. Uncle Luo Han could hardly believe that he had escaped so easily. His feet led him onto the decaying wooden bridge, fish were flipping in the water, the stream was gurgling, and the shooting stars lit up the sky. It seemed as if nothing had happened, nothing had happened at all. Originally, Uncle Luo Han could have escaped back to the village, hidden, healed his wounds, and continued to live. However, when he was walking on the wooden bridge, he heard a restless mule on the south bank of the river let out a hoarse cry. Uncle Luo Han returned for the mule, brewing a heroic tragedy."
"The mules and horses were tied to dozens of wooden stakes not far from the fence, under them, the air was filled with the stench of urine and feces. The horses snorted, the mules gnawed at the stakes; the horses chewed on sorghum stalks, the mules defecated. Uncle Luohan stumbled every three steps, rushing into the group of mules and horses. He smelled the familiar scent of our two big black mules, he saw the familiar figures of our two big black mules. He lunged forward, trying to rescue his troubled companions, but the mules, these unreasonable beasts, swiftly turned their backsides and kicked up their hooves. Uncle Luohan murmured, ""Black mule, black mule, let's run away together!"" The mules angrily spun around, protecting their territory. They didn't recognize their master anymore, Uncle Luohan didn't realize that the fresh and old bloody smell on him, the fresh and old scars on him, had changed him. Uncle Luohan was confused, he stepped forward, a mule kicked up a hoof, hitting him on the hip. The old man flew sideways, lying on the ground, half of his body numb. The mule continued to kick with its backside raised, its horseshoes shimmering like a crescent moon. Uncle Luohan's hip bone was burning and swelling, feeling heavy and burdensome. He got up, fell sideways, and got up again. The village's thin-voiced rooster crowed again. The darkness gradually faded, the three stars shone more brilliantly, illuminating the shiny mule's buttocks and eyeballs."
"""Such two beasts!"""
"Grandpa Luohan, with a fire in his heart, turned around in a crooked manner, looking for a weapon. On the construction site of the irrigation canal, he found a sharp iron shovel. He walked without restraint, cursing, forgetting about the people and dogs a hundred steps away. He was free and easy, and any lack of freedom was due to fear. The gradually rising red glow in the east scattered as it rose, and the sorghum field before dawn was so quiet that it could explode at any moment. Grandpa Luohan, facing the morning glow, walked towards the two big black mules. He hated the black mules to the bone. The mules stood still, and Grandpa Luohan held the iron shovel level, aimed at one of the black mule's hind legs, and shoveled it hard. A cool shadow fell on the mule's hind leg. The mule swayed twice, immediately stood firm, and from the mule's head, there was a rough and heroic shocked and angry neigh. Immediately, the injured mule raised its buttocks high, and a stream of hot blood was sprinkled like raindrops, dripping on Grandpa Luohan's face. Grandpa Luohan took advantage of the gap and hit the other hind leg of the mule. The black mule sighed, its buttocks gradually fell, and it suddenly sat on the ground, with its two front legs still standing, its neck straightened by the reins, and its mouth facing the already gray-blue sky. The iron shovel was pressed by the mule's heavy buttocks, and Grandpa Luohan also squatted down. He used all his strength to pull out the iron shovel. He felt the blade of the iron shovel firmly embedded in the mule's leg bone. The other black mule, dumbfounded, watched its fallen companion, neighing like crying, like begging for mercy."
"Uncle Luohan held his shovel flat, pushing it towards it. It retreated with force, nearly snapping the reins. The wooden stake made a crackling sound, and in its fist-sized eyes, a dark blue light was flowing."
"""Are you scared? Beast! Where is your arrogance now? Beast! You ungrateful, double-dealing scoundrel! You traitorous mongrel who colludes with foreigners!"""
"Old man Luohan cursed angrily, shoveling a spade at the rectangular face of the black mule. The spade hit the wooden stake, and he swayed the handle up, down, left, and right to pull out the blade. The black mule struggled, its hind legs bent like a bow and arrow, and its bald tail swept the ground with a rustling sound. Old man Luohan aimed at the mule's face, and with a snap, the spade hit the mule's broad forehead. The sturdy skull collided with the blade, causing a tremor that was transmitted through the handle, making Old man Luohan's arms numb. The black mule was silent, its hooves flailing in confusion, and finally could not support itself. With a thud, it fell like a thick wall. The reins were abruptly cut, half hanging on the wooden stake, and half bending beside the mule's face. Old man Luohan stood silently with his hands down, the smooth handle of the spade slanted on the mule's head pointing to the sky. On the other side, dogs barked and people shouted, dawn broke, and from the sorghum field in the east, a crescent of blood-red morning sun appeared, the sunlight shining directly on Old man Luohan's half-opened black mouth."
