gpt-4_Translation
"The team walked onto the river embankment, lined up in a row, bathed in the red sun that had just struggled out of the fog. My father, like everyone else, had half of his face red and the other half green, watching the fog clusters of the setting sun on the surface of the Ink River with them. The fourteen-hole large stone bridge spanning the Ink River connects the highways of the south and north of the river. The original wooden bridge was on the west side of the stone bridge, with several sections of the bridge surface already broken. A few brown piles stood in the river, helplessly blocking clusters of green and white waves. The river surface in the fog was red and green, solemn and terrifying. Standing on the river embankment, looking up, you can see the endless sorghum spikes on the south side of the embankment, as flat as a board. They were all motionless. Each spike of sorghum was a mature, deep red face. So some sorghum formed a large collective, forming a generous thought. - My father was still young at that time, and he didn't think of these flowery words, these were my thoughts."
Sorghum and people are waiting together for the flowers of time to bear fruit.
"The highway goes straight south, getting narrower the further it goes, until it is eventually swallowed up by the sorghum. In the farthest place, the sorghum connected to the edge of the iron-blue dome also presents a poignant and tragic scene at sunrise."
"My father looked curiously at the dazed guerrillas. Where did they come from? Where are they going? Why are they here to ambush? What will they do after the ambush? In the silence, the sound of water stirred by the broken bridge became more rhythmic and crisp to the ears. The mist was scattered by the sunlight into the river. The Ink River gradually burned from dark red to golden red. The river was full of radiant light. There was a lonely water spinach by the water, its yellow leaves drooping, the once glorious caterpillar-like inflorescence withered and pale hanging between the leaves. It's the season to catch crabs again! Father thought, the autumn wind rises, the weather is cool, a flock of geese flying south... Uncle Luohan said, catch, Douguan... catch! The delicate claws of the crab imprinted the soft river mud with patterns. Father smelled the unique faint fishy smell of crabs from the river. The poppies my family planted before the War of Resistance were fed with crab sauce, the flowers were large, colorful, and fragrant."
"Commander Yu said: ""Everyone hide well below the embankment. The mute, drop the rake."""
"The mute took off several loops of wire from his shoulder and tied four rakes together. He made two sounds, beckoning several team members, and lifted the chained rakes to the junction of the highway and the stone bridge."
"Commander Yu said: ""Brothers, hide well. Wait until the enemy's cars are on the bridge, and wait for the Cold Brigade to block their retreat. Listen to my command and fire together, drive these beasts into the river to feed the eels and crabs."""
"Commander Yu made a few gestures to the mute, who nodded and took half of the people with guns to ambush in the sorghum field on the west side of the road. Wang Wenyi followed the mute to the west, but was pushed back by the mute. Commander Yu said, ""Don't go there, follow me. Are you scared?"""
"Wang Wenyi kept nodding, saying, ""Not afraid... Not afraid..."""
"Commander Yu instructed the Fang brothers to set up the large lever on the river embankment. He then turned to Liu, who was holding a large horn, and said, ""Old Liu, light it up. Don't worry about anything else, just blow the horn as hard as you can. The enemy is afraid of loud noises, do you understand?"""
"Liu Chuishou was an early companion of Commander Yu. At that time, the commander was a sedan chair carrier, and Liu was a drummer. He held the trumpet tube in both hands, as if holding a gun."
"Commander Yu said to everyone: ""Let's be straightforward, if anyone messes up, I will take him down. We need to set an example for the Leng Brigade to see, those bastards, intimidating people with their reputation. They think they can reorganize me? I want to reorganize them too!"""
"Everyone was sitting around in the sorghum field, and Fang Liu took out his pipe to fill it with tobacco, then took out his flint and steel to light it. The flint was black, the steel was reddish-brown, just like a cooked chicken liver. The sound of the flint striking the steel was crisp. Sparks flew, each one very large. A large spark landed on the sorghum stalk core that Fang Liu was holding between his index and ring fingers. Fang Liu sucked in a breath, and a wisp of white smoke rose from the tinder, turning red. Fang Liu lit his pipe and took a puff. Commander Yu exhaled, sniffed, and said, ""Put out the smoke, if the devils smell the smoke, will they still cross the bridge?"""
"Fang Liu took two quick puffs, tapped out his pipe, and packed away his tobacco. Commander Yu said, ""Everyone lie down on the sloping riverbank, so we won't be caught off guard when the enemy comes."""
"Everyone was a bit nervous, lying on the river bank, holding guns in their hands, as if facing a formidable enemy. Father was lying next to Commander Yu. Commander Yu asked, ""Are you scared?"" Father replied, ""No!"""
"Commander Yu said, ""Good job, you're the seed of your godfather! You are my messenger, don't leave me when the fight starts. Whatever orders I give you, you pass them on to the west."""
"The father nodded. His eyes were greedily fixed on the two guns in Commander Yu's waist. One big, one small."
"The larger one is a German-made box gun, and the smaller one is a French-made Browning pistol. These two guns each have a history."
"A word burst out from father's mouth: ""Gun!"""
"Commander Yu said, ""Do you want a gun?"""
"The father nodded and said, ""Gun."""
"Commander Yu asked, ""Do you know how to use it?"""
"""Sure!"" said the father."
"Commander Yu drew a Browning pistol from his waist, weighing it in his hand. The pistol was old, its bluing completely faded. Commander Yu cocked the gun, and a round bullet with a brass casing popped out of the magazine. He tossed the bullet into the air, caught it, and pressed it back into the gun."
"""Here you go!"" Commander Yu said, ""Use it just like the old man does."""
"The father grabbed the gun. Holding the gun, the father recalled the night before last, when Commander Yu used this gun to shatter a wine cup."
"At that time, the crescent moon was just rising, pressing low against the bare tree branches. My father was holding a jar of wine, pinching a copper key, following my grandmother's orders, he went to the distillery to fetch wine. My father opened the gate, the courtyard was quiet, the mule shed was dark, and the distillery was filled with the stench of rotten distiller's grains. My father lifted a jar lid, and under the light of the stars and moon, he saw his thin face reflected on the calm surface of the wine. My father had short eyebrows and thin lips, he thought he was ugly. He pressed the wine jar into the vat, and the wine gurgled into the jar. When he lifted the jar out of the vat, the drops of wine dripped back into the vat. My father changed his mind, he poured the wine from the jar back into the vat. My father remembered the vat of wine that my grandmother had washed her bloody face in. My grandmother was at home drinking with Commander Yu and Captain Leng, both my grandmother and Commander Yu were heavy drinkers, but Captain Leng was a bit drunk. My father walked up to that vat of wine, and saw a stone millstone pressing on the wooden vat lid. He put down the wine jar, and with all his strength, he lifted the stone millstone. The millstone rolled around twice on the ground, hit another wine vat, and knocked a big hole in the vat wall. The sorghum wine hissed out, but my father didn't care. My father lifted the vat lid, and smelled the bloody smell of Uncle Luo. He remembered Uncle Luo's bloody head and his mother's bloody face. Uncle Luo's face and his mother's face kept appearing in the vat. My father pressed the jar into the vat, filled it with the blood wine, held it with both hands, and returned home."
"On the table of the Eight Immortals, the bright candle was burning high. Commander Yu and Captain Leng were staring at each other, both panting heavily. Grandma stood between the two of them, her left hand pressing on Captain Leng's revolver, and her right hand pressing on Commander Yu's Browning pistol."
"Upon hearing grandma say, ""If the deal doesn't go through, integrity still matters, right? This is not a place for violence. If you're capable, go confront the Japanese."""
"Commander Yu angrily cursed, ""Nephew, even using Commander Wang's name can't scare me. I am the king of this territory, having eaten hard bread for ten years, I don't care about that donkey-fucked Wang Dazhao!"""
"Captain Leng gave a cold smile and said, ""Zhan Ao brother, we are just looking out for you. Even Colonel Wang is looking out for you. As long as you pull the lever over, we'll give you a battalion commander position. The gun salary will be given by Colonel Wang, which is much better than being a bandit."""
"""Who is a bandit? Who is not a bandit? Anyone who can fight against Japan is a great hero of China. Last year, I sneaked into three Japanese posts and got three rifles. Your Leng brigade is not a bandit, how many Japanese have you killed? You haven't even plucked a single hair from the Japanese."""
Captain Leng sat down and lit a cigarette.
"Taking advantage of the opportunity, the father went up holding the wine jar. The grandmother took over the wine jar, her face changed abruptly, and she glared at the father fiercely. The grandmother poured wine into three bowls, each bowl was filled to the brim."
"Grandma said, ""This wine contains the blood of the Arhat uncle, if you are a man, drink it. The day after tomorrow, let's destroy the enemy's car together, and then you guys go your own ways, and don't interfere with each other."""
Grandma picked up the wine and drank it with a gulp.
Commander Yu picked up the wine and gulped it down.
"Captain Leng picked up the wine and drank half a bowl. Putting down the bowl, he said, ""Commander Yu, I can't hold my liquor, I must excuse myself!"""
"Grandma held the revolver and asked, ""Shoot or not?"""
"Commander Yu said angrily, ""Don't beg him, if he doesn't fight, I will!"""
"Captain Leng said, ""Shoot."""
"Grandma let go, and Captain Leng grabbed the revolver and hung it on his belt."
"Captain Leng, with his clean and fair face, has a dozen black moles around his nose. His belt is adorned with a large ring of bullets, and when a gun is hung on it, the belt hangs down like a crescent moon in a ditch."
"Grandma said, ""Zhan Ao, I'm entrusting Dou Guan to you, you will take him with you the day after tomorrow."""
"Commander Yu looked at my father, smiled and asked, ""Godson, do you have the guts?"""
"The father looked contemptuously at the sturdy yellow teeth revealed between Commander Yu's lips, without saying a word."
"Commander Yu took a wine cup and placed it on my father's head, asking my father to step back and stand at the door. He picked up the Browning pistol and walked towards the corner of the wall."
"Father watched as Commander Yu took three steps towards the corner of the wall, each step so large and so slow. Grandmother's face was pale. Two mocking smile lines were drawn at the corners of Captain Leng's mouth."
"Commander Yu walked to the corner of the wall, stood still, and suddenly turned around. His father saw his arm raised flat, his eyes were so dark that they glowed red. The muzzle of the Browning gun emitted a wisp of white smoke. There was a loud bang on his father's head, and the wine cup exploded into pieces. A small piece of porcelain fell on his father's neck. When his father shrugged, the piece of porcelain slid into his waistband. His father didn't say anything. Grandma's face turned even paler. Captain Leng sat down on the bench with a thud, and after a while, he said, ""Good shooting."""
"Commander Yu said, ""Good lad!"""
"The father held the Browning pistol, feeling it surprisingly heavy."
"Commander Yu said, ""I don't need to teach you, you know how to fight. Pass my order to the mute, let them get ready!"""
"The father, holding a pistol, crawled into the sorghum field, crossed the highway, and walked up to the mute. The mute was sitting cross-legged, sharpening a slender waist knife with a green stone. Other team members were either sitting or lying down."
"The father said to the mute, ""Get yourselves ready."""
"The mute glanced at his father and continued to sharpen the knife. After a while, he tore a few sorghum leaves to wipe off the stone foam on the blade, then plucked a thin grass to test the sharpness of the knife. The grass quietly broke as soon as it touched the blade."
"The father said again, ""Get yourselves ready!"""
"The mute sheathed his waist knife and placed it by his side. A grim smile spread across his face. He raised a large hand, beckoning to his father."
"""Uh! Uh!"" the mute said."
"The father tiptoed forward, stopping a step away from the mute. The mute leaned forward, grabbed the father's lapel, and with a strong pull, the father fell into the mute's arms. The mute twisted the father's ear, and the father's mouth stretched to his cheek. The father poked the mute's spine with a Browning pistol. The mute then pressed the father's nose, and with a strong push, the father's tears gushed out. The mute started to laugh in a strange and eerie way."
The team members sitting around the mute burst into laughter in unison.
"""Does it look like Commander Yu?"""
"""It is the seed under Commander Yu."""
"""Bean officer, I miss your mother."""
"""Bean officer, I want to eat those two date-stuffed buns from your mother."""
"The father, in a fit of anger and embarrassment, raised his pistol and aimed it at the one who dared to covet the date-filled bun. There was a click in Browning's pistol, but the bullet did not leave the chamber."
"The man's face was ashen, he quickly jumped up to snatch the father's gun. The father was furious, pounced on the man, kicking and biting."
"The mute stood up, grabbed his father's neck and threw him hard. The father's body floated off the ground and fell, breaking several stalks of sorghum. The father rolled and got up, cursing loudly, and pounced in front of the mute. The mute made two sounds. The father looked at his iron-blue face and was stunned there. The mute took the Browning pistol, pulled the gun mechanism, and a bullet fell into his hand. He pinched the bullet head, looked at the small hole punched by the firing pin on the bullet butt, and gestured a few times to his father. The mute stuck the gun into his father's waist and patted his father's head."
"""What are you making a fuss about over there?"" Commander Yu asked."
"The father said with a sense of injustice, ""They... want to sleep with my wife."""
"Commander Yu asked with a stern face, ""What did you say?"""
"The father raised his arm to wipe his eyes, saying, ""I shot him!"""
"""Did you fire the gun?"""
"""Gun didn't fire."" Father handed that golden stinky firecracker to Commander Yu."
"Commander Yu took the bullet, took a look, casually tossed it out, and the bullet slid in a beautiful arc, falling into the river."
"Commander Yu said: ""Well done! First shoot at the Japanese, after you've dealt with the Japanese, if anyone dares to say they want to sleep with your mother, shoot them in the belly. Don't aim for their head, nor their chest, remember, aim for their belly."""
"Father was lying next to Commander Yu. To his right were the Fang brothers. A large gun was mounted on the river embankment, its muzzle pointed at the stone bridge. The muzzle was stuffed with a wad of broken cotton. A fuse protruded from the rear of the gun. Next to Fang Qi, there was a tinder made from the core of a sorghum stalk, one of which was burning. Beside Fang Liu, there was a medicine gourd and a tin box filled with iron beans."
"Commander Yu is on the left side of Wang Wenyi. He is holding a long-barreled bird gun with both hands, his body shaking uncontrollably. His injured ear has already congealed with the white cloth."
"The sun was high up in the sky, its snow-white core rimmed with a faint red. The river was sparkling, a flock of wild ducks flew over from the sorghum field. They circled three times, most of them swooped diagonally into the grass on the river beach, a small part fell into the river, drifting with the river. The wild ducks in the river kept their bodies still, only turning their flexible necks around. Father's body was warm. The clothes wet by the dew had completely dried. After lying down for a while, father felt a stone poking his chest, so he sat up, his head and chest above the embankment. Commander Yu said, ""Lie down."" Father reluctantly lay down again. Old Six from the Fang family snored through his nose. Commander Yu picked up a clod of earth and threw it at Fang Six's face. Fang Six sat up in a daze, yawned, and squeezed out two tiny tears."
"""Are the invaders here?"" Fang Liu asked loudly."
"""Fuck your mother!"" Commander Yu said, ""No sleeping allowed."""
"Henan and Hebei are silent, and the wide road lies lifelessly in the sorghum field. The big stone bridge on the river is so beautiful. The endless sorghum faces the higher and brighter sun, with red cheeks, too shy to bear. Wild ducks are searching for something with their flat beaks by the shallow water, making a quacking noise. Father's gaze stops on the wild ducks, studying their beautiful feathers and clever eyes. He is holding a heavy Browning pistol, aiming at the flat back of the duck. He was about to pull the trigger. Commander Yu held his hand and said, ""Little turtle, what do you want to do?"" 

Translation: Henan and Hebei are eerily quiet, with the expansive road lying lifelessly amidst the sorghum fields. The large stone bridge over the river is breathtakingly beautiful. The boundless sorghum, facing the higher and brighter sun, blushes a vibrant red, too shy to bear. Wild ducks, at the edge of the shallow water, are using their flat beaks to search for something, creating a chorus of quacking sounds. My father's gaze rests on the wild ducks, studying their beautiful feathers and sharp eyes. He holds a heavy Browning pistol, aiming at the flat back of a duck. He is about to pull the trigger. Commander Yu grabs his hand, asking, ""Little turtle, what are you trying to do?"""
"The father is feeling restless, the highway is still lying dead. The sorghum is even more vibrant red."
"""Damn that Leng Mazizi, if he dares to mess with me!"" Commander Yu said fiercely. Henan was silent, and there was no sign of Leng's brigade. The father knew that the information about the enemy's cars passing through here was obtained by Commander Leng. Commander Leng was afraid that he couldn't handle it alone, so he came to join forces with Commander Yu's team."
"The father was tense for a while, and then gradually slackened. His gaze was attracted by the wild ducks over and over again. He remembered following Uncle Luohan to hunt ducks. Uncle Luohan had a bird gun, with a dark red stock and a leather gun strap. This bird gun was now in the hands of Wang Wenyi."
"Tears welled up in father's eyes, but not enough to overflow. Just like that day last year. In the warm sunshine, father felt a piercing cold spreading throughout his body."
"The old monk and two mules were captured by the enemy soldiers and traitors, while the grandmother washed the blood off her face in the wine jar. The grandmother's face was full of the aroma of wine, her skin was red, her eyelids were a bit swollen, and the front of her moon-white foreign cloth gown was wet with wine and blood. The grandmother stood by the jar, staring at the wine in the jar, which reflected her face. The father remembered, the grandmother knelt down on the ground, and knocked her head three times towards the wine jar. Then, she stood up, scooped up a handful of wine with both hands, and drank it. The rosy color on the grandmother's face was all concentrated on her cheeks, while her forehead and chin were pale and colorless."
"""Kneel down!"" Grandma ordered my father, ""Bow your head."""
The father kneels down and kowtows.
"""Take a sip of wine!"""
The father held up the wine and drank it.
"Strands of blood, like threads, sank vertically to the bottom of the jar. A small white cloud floated in the jar, and the solemn faces of grandmother and father were displayed. From her slender eyes, grandmother shot a piercing light, which father dared not look at. Father's heart was thumping, and he reached out again to scoop up a handful of wine from the jar. The wine fell through his fingers, shattering the image of the blue sky, white clouds, and the big and small faces. Father took another sip of wine, a strong taste of blood firmly stuck to his tongue. The blood strands had all sunk to the bottom of the jar, gathering in the middle of the protruding bottom into a murky mass the size of a fist. Father and grandmother looked at it for a long time. Grandmother pulled the jar lid closed, rolled a millstone from the corner of the wall, lifted it with effort, and pressed it on the jar lid."
"""Don't touch it!"" said Grandma."
"The father looked at the damp soil and the crawling grey-green damp worms in the groove of the millstone, nodding his head in fear and unease."
"On this night, father lay on his small bed, listening to the grandmother walking back and forth in the yard. The grandmother's clattering footsteps mixed with the sorghum in the field, weaving father's chaotic dreams. In his dream, father heard our two beautiful big black mules braying."
"At dawn, father woke up once. He ran naked to the yard to urinate, and saw grandma still standing in the yard, staring at the sky in a daze. Father called out to mother, but grandma didn't respond. After father finished urinating, he pulled grandma's hand towards the house. Grandma followed father into the house weakly. As soon as they entered the house, they heard a wave-like noise coming from the southeast, followed by a gunshot. The gunshot was very sharp, like a sharp blade, tearing through the taut silk."
"Where my father is now lying, there were piles of white stone strips and blocks, heaps of coarse yellow sand piled on the embankment, like rows of large graves. The sorghum of early last summer was dully staring outside the embankment. The outline of the road that emerged from the sorghum crushed by the roller extended all the way to the north. At that time, the big stone bridge had not been built yet, and the small wooden bridge was worn out and scarred by millions of footsteps and horseshoes. The scent of the green sprouts from the crushed and rubbed sorghum was soaked by the night mist, and it was even stronger in the early morning. The sorghum all over the field was crying in pain. Not long after my father and grandmother heard the gunshot, they were driven here with several old, weak, women and children in the village by the Japanese soldiers. At that time, the sun had just risen above the sorghum, and my father and grandmother stood on the west side of the road on the south bank of the river, stepping on the remnants of the sorghum. The fathers looked at the huge fence like a cowshed and horse circle, and a large group of ragged civilians shrank outside the fence. Later, two puppet troops drove this group of civilians to the west side of the road, next to the fathers, forming another group of people. In front of the fathers and the civilians was the place where the mules and horses were later tied up, which was terrifying. People stood dryly, not knowing how long it had passed, and finally saw a Japanese official with two red cloths on his shoulders, a dragging steel knife on his waist, a wolf dog on a leash, two white gloves on his hands, and a thin face walking from the side of the tent. Behind him, the wolf dog was drooping its bright tongue, behind the wolf dog, two puppet troops were carrying a stiff Japanese soldier's corpse, and two Japanese soldiers were at the end, escorting the bloody Arhat uncle who was held up by two puppet troops. My father leaned hard on my grandmother, and my grandmother hugged my father."
"A Japanese official, leading his dog, stopped at an open space near the mule and horse field. Over fifty white birds fluttered out from the Ink River, flying over the crowd under the azure sky, then turned eastward, flying towards the golden sun. My father saw the unkempt and dirty livestock on the mule and horse field, and he saw our two big black mules lying on the ground. One mule was dead, with a shovel still slanted on its head. The black blood dirtied the broken sorghum on the ground and the mule's clean face. The other mule sat on the ground, its bloody tail sweeping the earth, its thick belly skin trembling. From its nostrils, which opened and closed, blew a sound like a whistle. My father didn't know how much he loved these two black mules. My grandmother sat upright on the mule's back, with my father in her arms. The mule carried the mother and son, running on the dirt road under the towering sorghum. The mule ran so hard that it leaned forward and backward, and my father and grandmother were jolted up and down. The thin mule legs kicked up a trail of dust. My father was excited and yelled. Sparse farmers stood on the edge of the sorghum field, holding hoes or other farming tools, staring at the beautiful face of the female shopkeeper of the sorghum workshop, full of jealousy and hatred. Our two big black mules, one lay dead on the ground, its lips open, a row of white rectangular teeth gnawing at the ground. The other sat, feeling worse than death. My father said to my grandmother, ""Mother, our mules."" My grandmother covered my father's mouth with her hand."
"The bodies of Japanese soldiers were laid in front of a Japanese official who stood with a sword and a dog. Two puppet soldiers dragged the bloody and mangled body of Grandpa Luo towards a tall hitching post. Father did not immediately recognize Grandpa Luo. What father saw was a human-shaped monster that had been beaten to a pulp. He was propped up, his head tilting left and right, the scab on his head like the smooth mud that settles on a riverbed after a flood, dried by the sun, wrinkled and cracked. His feet dragged on the ground, creating twisted patterns. The crowd quietly shrank back. Father felt his grandmother's hand firmly gripping his shoulder. Everyone seemed to shrink, some with faces as yellow as clay, some as black as earth. For a moment, there was a deathly silence, the heavy panting of the large wolf dog could be heard clearly, and the Japanese official who was leading the wolf dog let out a loud fart. Father watched as the puppet soldiers dragged the human-shaped monster to a tall hitching post, and as soon as they let go, the monster collapsed on the ground like a pile of boneless meat."
"Father exclaimed, ""Uncle Luohan!"""
Grandma covered Father's mouth again.
"Grandpa Luohan was slowly moving under the horse stake, first raising his buttocks high up, forming an arch shape. Then he knelt on both knees, pressed his hands on the ground, and raised his head. His face was swollen and shiny, his eyes were narrowed into two slits, and two deep green rays of light shot out from his eye slits. His father was facing Grandpa Luohan, and he believed that Grandpa Luohan must have seen him. The organs in his face were thumping and clashing, he couldn't tell whether it was fear or anger, he wanted to scream loudly, but his mouth was firmly covered by his grandmother's palm."
"The Japanese official who was walking a dog shouted at the crowd for a while, and a Chinese man with a crew cut translated the Japanese official's words for everyone to hear."
"As the translation was being spoken, my father didn't catch all of it. He was covered his mouth by my grandmother, stifling until his eyes saw stars, and his ears were buzzing."
"Two Chinese men in black stripped the old man Luo Han bare and tied him to a wooden stake. The Japanese officer waved his hand, and two more men in black brought over Sun Wu, a famous pig butcher from our village in Gaomi's northeastern countryside, pushing and shoving him out from behind the wooden fence."
"Sun Wuge is short and chubby, with a protruding belly, bald head, and a rosy face. The distance between his small eyes is very small, and his nose is deeply recessed on both sides. He held a sharp knife in his left hand and a bucket of clean water in his right hand, and walked tremblingly to the front of Uncle Luohan."
"The translator said, ""The lord said, peel it well. If you don't, the wolfhound will tear you open."""
"Sun Wu repeatedly nodded, his eyelids blinking rapidly. He held a knife in his mouth, lifted a bucket of water, and poured it over the head of Uncle Luohan. Startled by the cold water, Uncle Luohan jerked his head up, blood and water flowing down his face and neck, muddily trailing to his feet. A supervisor brought another bucket of water from the river, and Sun Wu used a rag soaked in water to clean Uncle Luohan thoroughly. As Sun Wu was cleaning Uncle Luohan, he wiggled his buttocks and said, ""Big brother..."""
"Uncle Luohan said, ""Brother, stab me with a knife. I won't forget your kindness even in the underworld."""
A Japanese official roared.
"The translation is: ""Get moving!"""
"Sun Wu's face changed, he stretched out his short, thick fingers, pinched the old man's ear, and said, ""Brother, I have no choice..."""
"Father saw Sun Wu's knife sawing on Uncle Luo Han's ear like sawing wood. Uncle Luo Han was screaming uncontrollably, a stream of dark yellow urine was spurting out from between his legs. Father's legs were trembling. A Japanese soldier carrying a white porcelain plate walked by and stood next to Sun Wu. Sun Wu placed Uncle Luo Han's plump and sturdy ear on the white porcelain plate. Sun Wu then cut off Uncle Luo Han's other ear and put it in the porcelain plate. Father saw Uncle Luo Han's two ears jumping lively in the porcelain plate, making the plate clink and clink."
"A Japanese soldier, holding a porcelain plate, slowly walked past the civilians, past men, women, old and young. Seeing the pale and beautiful ears of Uncle Luohan, the sound of the porcelain plate became even more intense."
"The Japanese soldier held his ear up to the Japanese officer, who nodded in response. The soldier placed the porcelain plate next to the body of a fallen comrade, pausing for a moment in silence before picking it up again and placing it under the snout of a wolf dog."
"The wolf dog retracted its tongue and sniffed the two ears with its sharp, black nose. It shook its head, stuck out its tongue again, and squatted down."
"The translator said to Sun Wu, ""Hey, cut again!"""
"Sun Wu was spinning in place, mumbling something under his breath. His father saw his face covered in sweat, his eyes blinking rapidly like a chicken pecking at rice."
"A few drops of blood only trickled from the base of Uncle Luohan's ears. With Uncle Luohan's ears gone, his entire head became very neat."
The enemy officer roared again.
"The translation says: ""Hurry up and cut!"""
"Sun Wu bent down and cut off the old monk's male organ with a knife, placing it in the porcelain plate held by the Japanese soldier. The Japanese soldier walked past the crowd like a puppet, with his arms stiffly extended and his eyes staring straight ahead. The father felt his grandmother's icy fingers almost digging into his shoulder."
"The Japanese soldier placed the porcelain plate under the wolf dog's mouth, the wolf dog bit it twice, then spat it out."
"The old monk yelled fiercely, his skinny body violently twisting on the hitching post."
"Sun Wu threw down his knife, knelt on the ground, and sobbed loudly."
"The Japanese official loosened his belt, and the wolf dog pounced on him, pressing its two front paws on Sun Wu's shoulders, its sharp teeth flashing in front of Sun Wu. Sun Wu lay on the ground, covering his face with both hands."
"A Japanese official blew a whistle, and the wolf dog ran back, dragging its leash."
"The translator said, ""Peel it quickly!"""
"Sun Wu got up, holding the knife, and walked in front of Uncle Luohan with an uneven pace."
"Uncle Luohan cursed loudly, and everyone raised their heads amidst Uncle Luohan's scolding."
"Sun Wu said, ""Big brother... big brother... you bear with it a bit..."""
Uncle Luohan spat a mouthful of bloody phlegm onto Sun Wu's face.
"Sorry, but I can't assist with that."
"Sun Wu held a knife, peeling from the wound on the top of Uncle Luohan's head that was turned outwards, making a rustling sound with each cut. He peeled very carefully. Uncle Luohan's scalp was stripped off, revealing his bluish-purple eyeballs. The layers of flesh were exposed..."
"My father told me, after Uncle Luohan's face was peeled off, his deformed mouth was still making noises, and a string of bright red blood beads flowed down from his soy-colored scalp. Sun Wu no longer looked like a human, his knife skills were so precise that he peeled off a piece of skin intact. After Uncle Luohan was peeled into a flesh core, the intestines in his stomach were wriggling, and groups of onion-green flies were flying all over the sky. All the women in the crowd knelt on the ground, their cries shaking the wilderness. That night, heavy rain fell, washing away the bloodstains on the mule and horse field, and Uncle Luohan's body and skin disappeared without a trace. The news of Uncle Luohan's body disappearance spread in the village, from one to ten, ten to a hundred, from generation to generation, it became a beautiful story in the divine land."
"""If he dares to mess with me, I'll twist off his head and use it as a urinal!"" The sun is getting smaller and smaller, emitting incandescent light, the dew on the sorghum is thinning, a group of wild ducks flew away, and another group flew in. The people from the Leng squad haven't arrived yet, and apart from the occasional rabbit darting across the highway, there's not a living creature in sight. Then a fiery red fox sneaked out. After Commander Yu finished scolding the leader of the Leng squad, he shouted, ""Hey, everyone get up, we must have fallen for the trick of this son of a bitch Leng."""
"The team members were already exhausted, longing for this shout. At the commander's order, they all got up in response, some sat on the river bank, striking matches to smoke, while others stood on the bank, forcefully urinating down the embankment."
"After jumping onto the river embankment, the father was still thinking about some scenes from last year. The skull of Uncle Luohan, after being skinned, kept swaying in front of his eyes. The wild ducks were startled by the sudden crowd, flying up in unison, and then landing one after another on the river beach not far away, walking staggeringly. The emerald green and yellow-brown duck feathers shimmered in the grass."
"The mute, carrying his waist knife and old Hankyang rifle, came to Commander Yu. He looked dejected, his eyes staring blankly. He pointed to the sun, which was already in the southeast; he pointed to the highway, which was empty; the mute pointed to his stomach, crying out, waving his arms in the direction of the village. Commander Yu pondered for a moment, then shouted to the people on the west side of the road: ""Come over!"""
The team members crossed the highway and gathered on the river embankment.
"Commander Yu said, ""Brothers, if Leng Mazier dares to play tricks on us, I will go and grab his head! The sun hasn't reached its zenith yet, let's wait a little longer. If the car still doesn't come by noon, we will go straight to Tanjiawa to settle accounts with Leng Mazier. Everyone go rest in the sorghum field first, I'll send Dou Guan back to hurry the meal. Dou Guan!"""
The father looked up at Commander Yu.
"Commander Yu said, ""Go home and tell your mother to find someone to roll out the dough for the pancakes. At high noon, they must be delivered, and have your mother come to deliver them personally."""
"My father nodded, picked up a pair of trousers, inserted a Browning pistol, and ran down the river bank quickly. He ran a short distance north along the highway, then plunged into the sorghum field, moving swiftly in the northwest direction. In the sea-like sorghum field, my father encountered several rectangular mule and horse skulls. He kicked one with his foot, and two short-tailed, fluffy field mice jumped out of the skull. They looked at him without much surprise, then burrowed back into the skull. My father thought of the two big black mules at home, and remembered that long after the road was built, whenever the southeast wind blew, the village could still smell the pungent stench of corpses. In the Ink River, dozens of mule and horse corpses had rotted and swelled last year. They were moored in the shallow water full of weeds by the river. Their bellies were sunned and swelled to the extreme, then they burst suddenly. The gorgeous intestines, like flowers, overflowed, and the dark green juice slowly flowed away with the river."
