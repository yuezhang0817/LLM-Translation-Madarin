"On the ninth day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar in 1939, my father, a bandit seed, was just over fourteen years old. He followed the team of Commander Yu Zhan'ao, a legendary hero known all over the world, to ambush the enemy's car team on the Jiaoping Highway. My grandmother, wearing a padded jacket, saw them off to the edge of the village. Commander Yu said, ""Stop."" So my grandmother stopped. My grandmother said to my father, ""Douguan, listen to your godfather."" My father didn't make a sound, he looked at my grandmother's tall figure. Smelling the warm fragrance emanating from my grandmother's padded jacket, he suddenly felt a chill. He shivered and his stomach rumbled. Commander Yu patted my father's head and said, ""Let's go, godson."""
"The world was in chaos, with the scenery vaguely visible, and the mixed footsteps of the team had echoed far away. A blue and white mist curtain hung in front of my father, blocking his sight. He could only hear the footsteps of the team, but could not see its shape and shadow. My father tightly grabbed the corner of Commander Yu's clothes, his legs moving quickly. Grandma seemed to be getting further and further away from the shore, and the fog was like the sea, getting closer and more turbulent. My father held onto Commander Yu, as if he was holding onto the side of a boat."
"The father thus rushed towards his wordless blue stone tombstone standing in the bright red sorghum field of his hometown. The grass on his grave had already withered, and once a bare-bottomed boy led a snow-white goat here. The goat nibbled leisurely on the grass on the grave, while the boy stood on the tombstone, furiously peeing on it, then he began to sing loudly: The sorghum is red - The Japanese are coming - Compatriots, get ready - Fire the guns and cannons -"
"Some people say that the shepherd boy is me, but I don't know if it's me. I once had an extreme love for the northeastern town of Gaomi, and I once had an extreme hatred for it. After growing up and studying Marxism diligently, I finally realized: Gaomi's northeastern town is undoubtedly the most beautiful and ugliest, the most detached and worldly, the most sacred and filthy, the most heroic and scoundrel, the best at drinking and loving place on earth. My fellow villagers who live on this land love sorghum and plant it in large quantities every year. In the deep autumn of August, the boundless sorghum turns into a sea of blood, sorghum shines in Gaomi, sorghum is poignant and attractive, and sorghum love is surging. The autumn wind is bleak, the sun is strong, and plump white clouds float in the azure sky, with purple-red shadows of plump white clouds sliding on the sorghum. Teams of dark red people shuttle through the sorghum stalks and pull the nets, decade after decade. They kill and rob, they are loyal to the country, they have performed heroic and tragic dances, making us, the unworthy descendants who are alive, pale in comparison. As we progress, I truly feel a kind of degeneration."
"After leaving the village, the team proceeded on a narrow dirt road, with the rustling sound of crushed grass on the roadside mixed in the footsteps. The fog was dense and lively. On my father's face, countless tiny water droplets condensed into large water droplets, and a tuft of his hair stuck to his scalp. The faint mint scent and the slightly bitter and sweet smell of mature sorghum drifting from the sorghum fields on both sides of the road were already familiar to my father and nothing new. In this march in the fog, my father smelled a novel, yellow-red alternating fishy sweet smell. That smell faintly came through the smell of mint and sorghum, evoking a very distant memory deep in my father's heart."
"Seven days later, on the fifteenth of August, it was the Mid-Autumn Festival. A bright moon slowly rose, and the sorghum stood solemnly all over the ground. The sorghum ears were soaked in the moonlight, like they had been dipped in mercury, shining brightly. Under the broken moonlight, my father smelled a scent that was countless times stronger than it is now. At that time, Commander Yu was leading him by the hand through the sorghum field. More than three hundred villagers lay scattered, their bodies piled up, their fresh blood irrigating a large area of sorghum, soaking the black soil beneath the sorghum into thin mud, making their steps slow. The sweet and fishy smell was suffocating. A group of dogs that had come to eat human flesh sat in the sorghum field, their eyes staring intently at my father and Commander Yu. Commander Yu pulled out his revolver, flicked his wrist and fired, extinguishing the eyes of two dogs; another flick of his wrist, and the eyes of two more dogs were extinguished. The dogs scattered in a flurry, sitting far away, howling, greedily looking at the corpses. The sweet and fishy smell became even stronger. Commander Yu shouted, ""Japanese dogs! Dogs raised by a Japanese bitch!"" He fired all his bullets at the group of dogs, and the dogs ran away without a trace. Commander Yu said to my father, ""Let's go, son!"" The old and the young then walked towards the depths of the sorghum field in the moonlight. The sweet and fishy smell that permeated the fields soaked into my father's soul. In the even more intense and cruel years to come, this sweet and fishy taste accompanied him."
"The stems and leaves of the sorghum rustle in the fog, and the bright noise of the ink river that slowly flows through this low-lying plain in the fog is strong and weak, far and near. Catching up with the team, the sound of footsteps and heavy breathing echoed before and after my father. I don't know whose gun butt hit another's. I don't know whose foot stepped on a dead person's skull or something. The man in front of my father started to cough, and his cough was very familiar. When my father heard him cough, he thought of his two big ears that would congest when he was excited. The transparent, thin and blood-vessel-filled big ears are the eye-catching organs on Wang Wenyi's head. He is very short, with a big head shrunk in his raised shoulders. My father tried to look, his gaze pierced the thick fog, and saw Wang Wenyi's big head coughing and shaking. My father remembered that when Wang Wenyi was beaten on the drill field, his big head was so pitifully shaken. At that time, he had just joined Commander Yu's team. The adjutant shouted at him and the other team members on the drill field: Turn right--, Wang Wenyi happily stomped his feet, not knowing where to turn. The adjutant hit him on the butt with a whip, and he opened his mouth and yelled: Son of a bitch! The expression on his face was either crying or laughing. The children watching the scene outside the short wall all laughed."
Commander Yu kicked up and hit Wang Wenyi's buttock.
"Translate the following Chinese content: ""What are you coughing for?"""
"""Commander..."" Wang Wenyi said, suppressing a cough, ""My throat is itchy..."""
"""Don't even cough if you itch! You've exposed the target, I want your head!"""
"""Affirmative, Commander."" Wang Wenyi responded, followed by a bout of coughing."
"Father felt Commander Yu's hand loosen from the back of Wang Wenyi's neck. He also noticed two ripe grape-like purple handprints left on Wang Wenyi's neck. From Wang Wenyi's deep blue eyes, full of fear and unease, a few sparks of gratitude and grievance burst forth."
"Soon, the team drilled into the sorghum field. My father instinctively felt that the team was heading southeast. The dirt road they had just walked was the only road leading directly from the village to the Ink River. This narrow dirt road is pale green during the day. The road was originally built with black soil, but after being trampled for a long time, the black color settled to the bottom. The road was imprinted with countless petal hoof prints of cattle and sheep and semi-circular hoof prints of mules and donkeys. Horse, mule, and donkey dung looked like withered apples, cow dung looked like worm-eaten pancakes, and sheep dung was scattered like fallen black beans. My father often walked this road, and later when he was suffering in a Japanese charcoal kiln, this road often flashed in front of his eyes. My father didn't know how many romantic and tragic dramas my grandmother had starred in on this dirt road, but I did. My father also didn't know that on the black soil covered by the shadow of the sorghum, my grandmother's white and smooth body had once lain, but I did."
"After turning into the sorghum field, the fog became more stagnant, of greater mass, and less fluid. When the bodies of people and the objects they carried collided with the sorghum stalks, large heavy droplets of water fell down with the resentful rustling sound of the sorghum. The water droplets were cool and refreshing, with a delicious taste. When my father looked up, a large droplet accurately fell into his mouth. In the soothing fog, my father saw the heavy heads of the sorghum swaying. The flexible leaves of the sorghum, covered with dew, were sawing against my father's clothes and cheeks. The small wind stirred by the swaying sorghum launched a short attack on my father's head, and the sound of the flowing water in the Ink River became louder and louder."
"My father used to play in the Ink River, his swimming skills seemed to be innate, my grandmother said he was more eager to see water than his own mother. At the age of five, my father could dive like a little duck, with his pink buttocks pointing to the sky and his feet raised high. He knew that the silt at the bottom of the Ink River was shiny black and as soft as grease. On the damp mudflats by the river, there were clusters of grey-green reeds and goose-green plantains, as well as ground-growing wild kudzu vines and upright boneset plants. The mud of the mudflats was full of the delicate claw marks of crabs. When the autumn wind rose and the weather cooled, flocks of geese flew south, sometimes forming a ""一"" shape, sometimes a ""人"" shape, and so on. The sorghum turned red, the west wind blew, the crabs' feet itched, and groups of crabs the size of horse hooves climbed onto the river beach at night to forage in the grass. Crabs like to eat fresh cow dung and the rotting bodies of animals. My father listened to the sound of the river, thinking of the autumn nights in the past, following our old companion, Uncle Liu Luohan, to catch crabs by the river. The night was grey as grapes, the golden wind strung the river, the sapphire sky was deep and boundless, and the green stars were particularly bright. The Big Dipper - the Big Dipper governs death, the Southern Dipper - the Southern Dipper governs life, the Octagonal Glass Well - missing a brick, the anxious Cowherd was about to hang himself, the worried Weaver Girl was about to jump into the river... all hung above their heads. Uncle Liu Luohan had worked in our family for decades, responsible for all the work of our family's distillery. My father followed Uncle Luohan's footsteps, just like following his own grandfather."
"A lantern made of four pieces of glass lit up in my father's fog-confused mind, and the kerosene smoke drilled out from the iron sheet on the lampshade and the drilled iron sheet. The light was dim, only illuminating the darkness within five or six meters. The river water flowed into the lamp shadow, as lovely as a ripe apricot, but it passed by in a flash, and the river water in the darkness reflected the stars of the day. My father and Uncle Luo Han, wearing raincoats, sat by the lampshade, listening to the low sobbing of the river - a very low sobbing. The excited calls of foxes looking for mates occasionally echoed from the endless sorghum fields on both sides of the river. Crabs were attracted to the light and gathered towards the lamp shadow. My father and Uncle Luo Han sat quietly, listening to the whispers of the world, and the smell of the mud at the bottom of the river rose up. Groups of crabs gathered around, forming a restless circle. My father was anxious and eager to get up, but Uncle Luo Han held him down. ""Don't rush!"" Uncle said, ""You can't drink hot porridge in a hurry."" My father suppressed his excitement and remained still. The crabs stopped when they crawled into the light, covering the ground from head to tail. A piece of green crab shell was shining, and a pair of cylindrical eyes shot out from the sunken eye sockets. The mouth hidden under the inclined face spat out strings of colorful foam. The crabs challenged people with colorful foam, and my father's long hair on his raincoat stood up. Uncle Luo Han said, ""Catch!"" My father sprang up in response, and he and Uncle Luo Han rushed over, each grabbing two corners of the dense net that had been laid on the ground, lifting a piece of crab and revealing the river beach under the crab. My father and Uncle Luo Han tied up the two corners and threw them aside, then lifted the net piece with the same speed and skill. Each net was so heavy, I don't know how many hundreds or thousands of crabs were caught."
"After father followed the team into the sorghum field, due to his mind wandering with the crabs, his feet and legs did not choose gaps, bumping the sorghum stalks in all directions. His hand was always tightly pulling the corner of Commander Yu's clothes, half of him was walking on his own, and the other half was being led by Commander Yu. He even felt a bit sleepy, his neck stiff, and his eyes dry and dull. Father thought, as long as he followed Uncle Luo Han to the Ink River, there was no reason to return empty-handed. Father was tired of eating crabs, and so was grandma. It was tasteless to eat, but a pity to discard. Uncle Luo Han used a sharp knife to chop the crab into pieces, ground it into a paste in a tofu mill, added salt, put it in a jar, and made crab paste, which was eaten year after year. If it was not finished, it would stink, and if it stank, it would be fed to poppies. I heard that grandma smoked opium but was not addicted, so she always looked fresh and clear, and the poppy flowers fed with crabs were fat and strong, with a mix of pink, red, and white, and a fragrant smell. The black soil of my hometown is surprisingly fertile, so the products are abundant, and the people are excellent. The high-spirited and healthy mentality of the people is the mentality of my hometown. The eels produced in the Ink River are as fat as meat sticks, with a thorn from head to tail. They are dull and swallow when they see a hook. The Uncle Luo Han that father thought of died last year, died on the Jiaoping Highway. His body was cut into pieces and thrown here and there. The skin on his torso was peeled off, and the flesh was jumping, like a big frog after shedding its skin. Every time father thought of Uncle Luo Han's body, his spine would feel cold. Father also remembered a night about seven or eight years ago, when my grandmother got drunk and was leaning against a stack of sorghum leaves in the yard of our liquor distillery at home. She hugged Uncle Luo Han's shoulder and whispered, ""Uncle... don't leave, look at the Buddha's face if not the monk's, look at the water's face if not the fish's, look at Dou Guan's face if not mine, stay, if you want me... I will give you... you are like my father..."" Father remembered that Uncle Luo Han pushed grandma aside and staggered into the mule shed to mix feed for the mules. Our family kept two big black mules and ran a sorghum liquor distillery, which was the richest in the village. Uncle Luo Han didn't leave and continued to serve as the business leader in our house until our two big black mules were taken by the Japanese to the Jiaoping Highway construction site for labor."
"At this moment, a long bray of a donkey came from the village left behind by his father and others. His father's spirit was lifted, his eyes opened, but what he saw was still the semi-solid, semi-transparent fog. The tall and upright stalks of sorghum formed a dense fence, vaguely hidden behind the fog, passing through row after row, endlessly. How long he had been in the sorghum field, his father had forgotten. His thoughts lingered in the distant, bustling, fertile river, lingered in the memories of the past, and he didn't even know why he was rushing into the dreamy sea of sorghum. His father lost his bearings. He had once lost his way in the sorghum field the year before last, but in the end, he found his way out, guided by the sound of the river. Now, listening to the revelation of the river again, he quickly understood that the team was moving southeast, towards the direction of the river. Once the direction was clear, his father understood that this was to ambush, to kill the Japanese, like killing dogs. He knew that the team was heading southeast and would soon reach the Jiaoping Highway, which runs north-south, dividing the vast low-lying plain in half, and connecting the two county towns of Jiaoxian and Pingdu. This highway was built by the Japanese and their puppets, forcing the common people with whips and bayonets."
"The commotion of the sorghum became frequent and intense due to people's fatigue and exhaustion, and the accumulated dew continuously fell, wetting everyone's scalp and neck. Wang Wenyi kept coughing, and he didn't correct his behavior even after being scolded by Commander Yu. My father felt that the highway was about to arrive, and the shadow of the road was swaying dimly in front of his eyes. Unconsciously, some voids appeared in the continuous fog sea, and the sorghum stalks, wetted by the dew, were looking at my father sorrowfully in the fog hole, and my father was also looking at them devoutly. My father suddenly realized that they were all living spirits. They rooted in the black soil, received the essence of the sun and the moon, and were nourished by rain and dew. They knew astronomy above and geography below. From the color of the sorghum, my father guessed that the sun had been burned into a pitiful bright red by the horizon blocked by the sorghum."
"Suddenly, an unexpected event occurred. First, the father heard a sharp whistle in his ear, followed by the sound of something bursting in front of him."
"Commander Yu shouted loudly, ""Who fired the gun? Brother-in-law, who fired the gun?"""
"The father heard the bullet pierce through the thick fog, passing through the sorghum leaves and stalks, a sorghum head fell to the ground. For a moment, everyone held their breath. That bullet screamed all the way, not knowing where it had fallen. The fragrant gunpowder smoke diffused into the fog. Wang Wenyi screamed: ""Commander - I have no head - Commander - I have no head -"""
"Commander Yu was taken aback, kicked Wang Wenyi, and said, ""Damn it! Can you still talk without a head!"""
"Commander Yu left my father and went to the front of the team. Wang Wenyi was still wailing. My father stepped forward and saw Wang Wenyi's grotesque face clearly. On his cheek, there was a deep blue substance flowing. My father reached out and touched a handful of sticky and hot liquid. My father smelled a fishy smell that was almost the same as the ink river silt, but much fresher than the ink river silt. It overwhelmed the fragrance of mint, overwhelmed the sweetness and bitterness of sorghum, it awakened my father's increasingly pressing memory, like a thread stringing pearls, linking the ink river silt, the black soil under the sorghum, the past that will never die, and the present that will never stay together. Sometimes, everything will emit the smell of human blood."
"""Uncle,"" Father said, ""Uncle, you are injured."""
"""Bean officer, you are the bean officer, right? Can you see if the uncle's head is still growing on his neck?"""
"""Sir, you look fine, but your ear is bleeding."""
"Wang Wenyi reached out to touch his ear, only to find his hand covered in blood. After a scream, he collapsed, ""Commander, I'm injured! I'm injured, I'm injured."""
"Commander Yu came back from the front, squatted down, pinched Wang Wenyi's neck, and said in a low voice, ""Don't shout, if you shout again, I will kill you!"""
Wang Wenyi dared not call anymore.
"""Where did you get hurt?"" Commander Yu asked."
"""Ear......"" Wang Wenyi said, crying."
"Commander Yu pulled out a piece of cloth that looked like a bundle from his waist, tore it in half with a snap, handed it to Wang Wenyi, and said, ""Hold this first, don't make a sound, follow me, we'll bandage it on the road."""
"Commander Yu called out again: ""Officer Dou."" His father responded, and Commander Yu led him away by the hand. Wang Wen Yi followed behind, grumbling under his breath."
"The shot just now was accidentally fired when the tall mute, who was clearing the way with a harrow on his head, fell down. The mute is an old friend of Commander Yu, a grassroots hero who has shared ""hand cakes"" in the sorghum field. One of his feet was injured in his mother's womb, so he walks with a limp, but very fast. My father is a bit afraid of him."
"The heavy fog around dawn finally dissipated when Commander Yu's team stepped onto the Jiaoping Highway. August in the hometown is a season of heavy fog, perhaps due to the low-lying terrain and damp soil. After stepping onto the highway, my father suddenly felt agile and light, his steps brisk and strong, he let go of the hand that was clutching the corner of Commander Yu's clothes. Wang Wenyi covered his bleeding ear with a white cloth, his face full of tears. Commander Yu clumsily bandaged his ear, wrapping up half of his head. Wang Wenyi gritted his teeth in pain."
"Commander Yu said, ""You have such a big life!"""
"Wang Wenyi said, ""My blood is drained, I can't go anymore!"""
"Commander Yu said: ""Nonsense, a mosquito bite is nothing more than this, have you forgotten about your three sons?"""
"Wang Wenyi bowed his head, mumbling, ""I didn't forget, I didn't forget."""
"He carries a long-barreled bird gun on his back, the butt of which is blood red. A flat iron box for gunpowder is slung diagonally on his buttocks."
"The remaining fog had retreated into the sorghum fields. The road was covered with a layer of coarse sand, devoid of any hoof prints of cattle and horses, let alone human footprints. In contrast to the dense sorghum on both sides of the road, the highway was desolate and absurd, giving a sense of foreboding. Father had long known that Commander Yu's team, a group of deaf, dumb, lame, and limping, was no more than forty people. But when these people lived in the village, they stirred up a lot of trouble, as if the village was full of soldiers. The team was huddled together on the road, more than thirty people, like a frozen snake. The weapons were of all lengths, including homemade guns, bird guns, old Hanyang rifles, and a large lever that could shoot out a small weight, carried by the two brothers Fang Liu and Fang Qi. The mute was carrying a rectangular rake used for leveling the land, with twenty-six iron teeth around it, and three other team members each carried one. At that time, Father didn't know what an ambush was, let alone why they needed to carry four iron-toothed rakes for an ambush."
