gpt-4_Translation
"When Yucun hurriedly turned around, it was not someone else, but Zhang Rugui, who was involved in the same case reform that day. He was originally a local, and lived at home after the reform. Today, when he heard the news that the capital had approved the restoration of the old staff, he started to look for opportunities and connections everywhere. He happened to meet Yucun, so he hurriedly congratulated him. After the two met and exchanged greetings, Zhang Rugui told Yucun about the news. Yucun was naturally overjoyed, and after a brief chat, they bid farewell and each returned home. When Leng Zixing heard this, he quickly offered a plan, asking Yucun to ask Lin Ruhai for help, and then to ask Jia Zheng in the capital. Yucun understood his intention, bid farewell and returned to the inn, and hurriedly searched for the newspaper to confirm the news."
"The next day, Lin Ruhai had a conversation with Jia Yucun. Ruhai said, ""By a fortunate coincidence, after my wife's death, my mother-in-law in the capital was concerned about my daughter, who has no one to rely on for education. She had already sent a ship to pick her up, but my daughter was not fully recovered, so she couldn't go. At this moment, I am thinking about the kindness of your teaching and I want to repay you. Please rest assured. I have already planned for this and have written a letter of recommendation. I entrust my brother-in-law to assist you. This is the only way I can express my sincerity. The expenses have been clearly stated in the letter to my brother-in-law, so you don't need to worry."" Yucun thanked Ruhai profusely and then asked, ""May I know what position your relative holds? I'm afraid I might be too presumptuous to rush into the capital."" Ruhai laughed and said, ""If we talk about my relatives, they are related to you. They are the grandsons of Rongguo Duke: the elder one is a first-class general, named She, styled Enhou; the second one is named Zheng, styled Cunzhou, currently serving as a member of the Ministry of Works. They are humble and kind, very much like their grandfather, not the frivolous and shallow officials. Therefore, I wrote the letter to trouble them. Otherwise, it would not only tarnish your reputation, but I would also disdain to do so."" After hearing this, Yucun believed what Zi Xing said yesterday and thanked Ruhai again. Ruhai then said, ""I have chosen the second day of the next month for my daughter to go to the capital. You can go with her, isn't it convenient for both?"" Yucun agreed obediently, feeling very pleased. Ruhai then prepared gifts and farewell matters, which Yucun accepted one by one."
"The female student, Daiyu, was recovering, and originally couldn't bear to leave her father. However, her maternal grandmother insisted that she must go, and also said: ""Your father is approaching fifty and has no intention of remarrying. Moreover, you are often ill and very young, with no mother to nurture you and no siblings to support you. Now, going with your maternal grandmother and cousins will relieve my worries. Why do you say you won't go?"" Upon hearing this, Daiyu shed tears and bid farewell, then followed her wet nurse and several old women from the Rong Mansion to board the boat. Yucun had another boat, with two young boys, who accompanied Daiyu on her journey."
"One day, when he arrived in the capital, he entered the imperial city. Yucun first dressed up, brought a young boy, holding the name card of his nephew, and threw it in front of the gate of Rong Mansion. At that time, Jia Zheng had already read the letter from his brother-in-law, and he quickly invited him in for a meeting. Seeing that Yucun was handsome and his speech was not vulgar, and Jia Zheng liked scholars the most, he respected the virtuous and the inferior, helped the weak and the dangerous, and had a great ancestral style; moreover, it was a message from his brother-in-law, so he treated Yucun preferentially, which was even more different, and he tried his best to help. On the day of the topic, he lightly planned a vacancy for reinstatement. In less than two months, the vacancy in Jinling Yingtian Mansion came out, so he planned to fill this vacancy, bid farewell to Jia Zheng, and chose a day to take office. It's not mentioned."
"Since the day when Daiyu abandoned the boat and landed, the Rongguo Mansion had sent a sedan chair and vehicles to wait for her luggage for a long time. Lin Daiyu often heard her mother say that her maternal grandmother's family was different from others. The few third-class maids she had seen recently were already extraordinary in terms of food, clothing, and use, let alone now at their home. Therefore, she was careful with every step, always mindful, and did not dare to speak one more word or take one more step, for fear of being ridiculed by others."
"After getting on the sedan chair and entering the city, she looked out through the gauze window, the prosperity of the market and the bustling population were different from other places. After half a day's journey, she suddenly saw two large stone lions squatting to the north of the street, a large gate with three animal heads, and about a dozen people in splendid attire sitting in front of the gate. The main gate was not open, only the doors at the east and west corners were in use. Above the main gate was a plaque with the five big characters ""Imperially Commissioned Ningguo Mansion"". Daiyu thought to herself, ""This must be the main branch of my maternal grandfather's family."" Thinking this, she continued westward, not far away, there was also a large gate with three entrances, which was Rongguo Mansion. Instead of entering the main gate, she entered the side gate on the west. The sedan bearers carried her in, walked a distance, and stopped to rest when they were about to turn a corner. The maids behind had already got off the sedan and caught up. Three or four well-dressed young boys of seventeen or eighteen came up and lifted the sedan chair again. The maids followed and stopped in front of a hanging flower gate. The boys withdrew, and the maids came up to lift the curtain of the sedan chair and helped Daiyu out. Lin Daiyu, holding the hand of a maid, entered the hanging flower gate. On both sides were cloistered corridors, in the middle was a hall, with a large screen of marble on a rosewood stand. Turning around the screen, there was a small three-room hall, behind which was the main courtyard at the back. The five rooms in the front all had carved beams and painted rafters, and the side rooms of the mountain-passing corridor were hung with various parrots and other birds. On the platform, several girls in red and green were sitting. When they saw them coming, they all rushed up with smiles and said, ""The old lady was just thinking about you, and you happened to come."" Then three or four people rushed to lift the curtain, and someone reported, ""Miss Lin has arrived."""
"When Daiyu just entered the room, she saw two people supporting an old woman with silver hair coming towards her. Daiyu knew it was her maternal grandmother. Just as she was about to pay her respects, she was already embraced by her grandmother, who was crying out loud. All the people standing by could not help but cover their faces and weep, and Daiyu could not stop crying either. After a while, everyone slowly persuaded them to stop, and Daiyu finally paid her respects to her grandmother. This is the Lady Shi that Leng Zixing mentioned, the mother of Jia She and Jia Zheng. Then, Lady Jia pointed out to Daiyu one by one: ""This is your eldest aunt; this is your second aunt; this is your elder brother Xianzhu's wife, your sister-in-law Zhudajie."" Daiyu paid her respects one by one. Lady Jia also said: ""Please call the girls over. Our guest has just arrived today, so there is no need to go to school."" Everyone agreed and two of them left."
"In a short while, three wet nurses and five or six maidservants came in, escorting three sisters. The first one had a slightly plump skin, a medium build, cheeks like fresh lychees, and a nose as smooth as goose fat, gentle and silent, endearing to look at. The second one had slender shoulders and waist, a tall and slender figure, a duck egg-shaped face, handsome eyes and well-shaped eyebrows, her gaze was lively, full of literary grace, and one would forget the mundane upon seeing her. The third one was not fully grown yet, and her appearance was still small. Their hairpins, rings, skirts, and jackets were all similarly adorned. Daiyu quickly got up to greet them and after recognizing each other, everyone sat down. The maidservants served tea. They talked about how Daiyu's mother fell ill, how she sought medical treatment, and how she passed away. It was inevitable that Grandma Jia would feel sad again, and she said: ""Of all my children, I loved your mother the most. Today, she has left me without even a chance to see her face. Seeing you today, how can I not be heartbroken!"" As she spoke, she hugged Daiyu in her arms and started to sob. Everyone hurriedly comforted her until she calmed down slightly."
"Everyone saw that although Daiyu was young in age, her manners and speech were not ordinary. Although her body and face were weak and frail, she had a natural elegance about her, indicating that she had some kind of illness. They asked, ""What medicine do you usually take, and why don't you urgently seek treatment?"" Daiyu replied, ""I've been like this since I can remember. I've been taking medicine since I could eat, and I haven't stopped to this day. I've consulted many famous doctors and tried many prescriptions, but none have worked. When I was three years old, I heard that a leper monk came and wanted to take me away to become a nun, but my parents naturally refused. He also said, 'If you can't bear to let her go, I'm afraid her illness will never be cured in her lifetime. If you want her to get better, from now on, she must never hear crying; apart from her parents, she must not see any relatives or friends with different surnames, only then can she live peacefully in this life.' He rambled on with these nonsensical words, and no one paid him any attention. Now I'm still taking ginseng nourishing pills."" Grandma Jia said, ""That's good, I'm just preparing some pills here. I'll have them prepare an extra batch for you."""
"Before the conversation was over, laughter was heard from the backyard, saying: ""I'm late, I didn't welcome the distant guest!"" Daiyu was puzzled and said: ""These people are all silent and respectful, who is this person who is so unrestrained and rude?"" As she was thinking, she saw a group of maids surrounding a person coming in from the back door. This person's dress was different from the other girls: colorful and splendid, like a goddess. She wore a golden eight-treasure pearl bun on her head, with a sunrise five-phoenix pearl hairpin; a red gold dragon necklace around her neck; a pea green palace tassel double balance rose pendant on her skirt; she wore a narrow jacket of red satin embroidered with golden butterflies, covered with a five-color carved silk turquoise silver rat coat; under it was a jade flowered satin skirt. She had a pair of triangular eyes like a red phoenix, two willow-leaf eyebrows, a slender figure, and a flirtatious body. Her powdered face concealed her spring-like charm, and her red lips smelled of laughter before they opened. Daiyu quickly got up to greet her. Grandma Jia laughed and said: ""You don't recognize her, she is a famous rascal in our place, commonly known in the southern province as 'spicy', you just call her 'Phoenix Spicy'."""
"Daiyu didn't know how to address her, but all her sisters quickly informed her, ""This is Sister-in-law Lian."" Although Daiyu didn't recognize her, she had heard her mother mention that Jia Lian, the son of her eldest uncle Jia She, had married the niece of her second aunt Wang, who had been raised as a boy since childhood, and her scholarly name was Wang Xifeng. Daiyu quickly greeted her with a smile, addressing her as ""sister-in-law""."
"Xi Feng took Daiyu's hand, carefully looked her up and down, and then led her to sit next to Grandma Jia. She laughed and said, ""I have never seen such a beautiful person in the world until today! Moreover, her whole demeanor is not like that of an ordinary granddaughter, but a direct granddaughter. No wonder Grandma Jia never forgets her for a moment. It's just a pity that my sister has such a hard fate, why did her mother have to die!"" As she spoke, she wiped her tears with a handkerchief. Grandma Jia laughed and said, ""I just got better, and you're trying to upset me. Your sister just arrived from a long journey, and her health is weak. I just managed to calm her down, so don't bring up the past."" Hearing this, Xi Feng quickly turned her sorrow into joy and said, ""That's right! As soon as I saw my sister, my whole heart was on her. I was both happy and sad, and I completely forgot about Grandma Jia. I deserve a beating, I deserve a beating!"" She then took Daiyu's hand and asked, ""How old are you, sister? Have you been to school? What medicine are you taking now? Don't miss home while you're here. If you want anything to eat or play with, just tell me. If the maids are not good, also tell me."" She then asked the old women, ""Has Miss Lin's luggage been brought in? How many people did she bring with her? You should clean up two rooms for them to rest as soon as possible."""
"When they were talking, tea and snacks had already been served. Xifeng personally served the tea and snacks. She saw her second aunt-in-law asked her, ""Has the monthly allowance been given out yet?"" Xifeng replied, ""The monthly allowance has already been distributed. I just took someone to the back building to look for satin. We've been looking for half a day, but we didn't find the kind that the madam mentioned yesterday. Perhaps the madam remembered it wrong?"" Lady Wang said, ""Whether it's there or not, it doesn't matter."" She then added, ""You should have taken out a couple for your younger sister to make clothes. Remember to send someone to get them tonight, don't forget."" Xifeng replied, ""I've already thought of that. I knew my younger sister would be here in a couple of days, so I've prepared it. I'll send it over after the madam has reviewed it."" Lady Wang smiled, nodded, and said nothing."
"The tea and snacks have been cleared away, and the Old Lady Jia ordered two old maids to take Daiyu to meet her two maternal uncles. At this time, Mrs. Xing, the wife of Jia She, also stood up and said with a smile, ""I can take my niece over, which is quite convenient."" Old Lady Jia laughed and said, ""Exactly, you go too, no need to come back."" Mrs. Xing responded with a ""yes"", and then took Daiyu to bid farewell to Lady Wang. Everyone sent them off to the front of the hall."
"After exiting the Hanging Flower Gate, a group of young servants had already pulled up a green carriage with a jade-green canopy. Lady Xing, accompanied by Daiyu, sat in it. The maids lowered the carriage curtain, and only then did they order the young servants to lift it up and pull it to a wider area. Then they drove the tamed mules and also left through the West Corner Gate, heading east past the main gate of the Rong Mansion, and then entered a large black-oiled gate. They only got off the carriage in front of the ceremonial gate. The young servants retreated, and only then did they lift the carriage curtain. Lady Xing, holding Daiyu's hand, entered the courtyard. Daiyu estimated that the houses and courtyards must have been separated from the garden in the Rong Mansion. After entering the triple ceremonial gate, they indeed saw the main room and the side rooms with their corridors, all of which were small and exquisite, unlike the grand and magnificent ones they had just seen. Moreover, trees, rocks, and mountains were everywhere in the courtyard. As they entered the main room, many beautifully dressed women and maids greeted them. Lady Xing let Daiyu sit down, and at the same time ordered someone to go to the study outside to invite Jia She. After a while, someone came back and said, ""The master said: 'I have been feeling unwell these days. Seeing the young lady would only make us both sad, so I can't bear to meet her for now. I advise the young lady not to miss home too much. Living with the old lady and her aunt is just like being at home. Although the sisters are not very clever, being together can alleviate some of the boredom. If there is any grievance, just speak up, don't be an outsider.'"" Daiyu quickly stood up and listened to each word. After sitting for a moment, she then excused herself."
"Mrs. Xing insisted on staying for dinner, but Daiyu replied with a smile, ""I appreciate Aunt's kindness in offering me a meal, and I shouldn't refuse. However, I still need to visit my second uncle. I'm afraid that if I accept your kind offer, I might be late, which would be disrespectful. I can accept your offer another day. I hope Aunt can understand."" Hearing this, Mrs. Xing laughed and said, ""That makes sense."" She then ordered two or three maids to take Daiyu to her destination in the same carriage. Daiyu then bid her farewell. Mrs. Xing accompanied her to the ceremonial gate, gave a few instructions to everyone, and only returned after watching the carriage leave."
"As soon as Daiyu entered the Rong Mansion, she got off the carriage. The maids led her around to the east, through a corridor running from east to west, to the back of the southern main hall, into a large courtyard within the ceremonial gate. Above were five large main rooms, with side rooms on both sides, deer-topped ear rooms and tunnels, all interconnected, magnificent and grand, different from Lady Dowager's place. Daiyu knew this was the main inner chamber, a large corridor leading directly to the main gate. Upon entering the hall, she first saw a large plaque with a red gold nine-dragon on a green background. The plaque had three large characters, ""Rong Xi Tang"", and a line of small characters, ""A certain year, month and day, the book was given to Rong Guogong Jia Yuan"", and ""Treasure of Wan Ji Chen Han"". On the large rosewood carved dragon case, there was a three-foot-tall ancient bronze tripod in green, a large painting of a dragon waiting to leak with the morning ink, a gold tripod on one side, and glass on the other. There were sixteen nanmu chairs in two rows on the ground, and a pair of couplets on a black wood plaque, with silver inlaid characters, which read:"
"The pearls and jades on the seat shine like the sun and the moon, the embroidery in front of the hall glows with the colors of the misty dawn."
"The small line below reads, ""The same fellow, the world teaches younger brother Xun to inherit the title of Dong'an County King Mu Shi, bows his hands and writes""."
"It turns out that Lady Wang often sat and rested, not in this main room, but in the three rooms to the east of this main room. So the old nurse led Daiyu into the east room. On the large kang near the window, there was a scarlet foreign rug, and in front of it was a large red gold coin python backrest, a stone blue gold coin python pillow, and an autumn fragrance color gold coin python large strip rug. On both sides, there was a pair of plum blossom style foreign lacquer small tables. On the left table, there were Wen Wang's tripod, chopsticks and incense box; on the right table, there was a Ru kiln beauty goblet - the goblet was filled with fresh flowers, as well as tea bowls, spittoons and other items. On the ground, there were four chairs in a row to the west, all covered with silver-red flower chair covers, and four pairs of footstools underneath. On both sides of the chair, there was also a pair of high tables, with tea bowls and flower vases all ready on the tables. The rest of the furnishings need not be detailed."
"The old maids asked Daiyu to sit on the kang, but there were two brocade cushions set on the edge of the kang. Daiyu, judging her position, did not go up to the kang, but sat on a chair on the east side. The maids in this room hurriedly brought up tea. As Daiyu was drinking tea, she was observing these maids, their makeup, clothes, and behavior, which were indeed different from other houses. Before she finished her tea, a maid wearing a red silk jacket and a green satin vest came over and said with a smile, ""Madam said, please Miss Lin go sit over there."" Upon hearing this, the old maids then led Daiyu out and into a small main room with three compartments in the east corridor."
"A kang table was horizontally placed on the front kang, with books and tea sets piled on it. Against the east wall facing west, there was a semi-old green satin backrest and pillow. Lady Wang, however, was sitting at the lower end of the west side, also on a semi-old green satin cushion. Seeing Daiyu coming, she moved to the east. Daiyu guessed that this must be Jia Zheng's seat. Seeing three chairs lined up against the kang, each covered with a semi-old ink pad, Daiyu sat on a chair. Lady Wang repeatedly invited her to sit on the kang, and she finally sat next to Lady Wang. Lady Wang said, ""Your uncle has gone to observe a fast today, so you'll see him another time. I have one thing to tell you: your three sisters are all very good. In the future, you will study, learn to read and write, and learn needlework together. Whether you are joking or laughing, you should always be respectful. But the one thing I'm worried about is this: I have a troublemaker in the house, the 'devil of the world'. He went to the temple to fulfill a vow today and hasn't come back yet. You'll know when you see him tonight. Just ignore him in the future, none of your sisters dare to provoke him."""
"Daiyu often heard her mother mention that her second aunt had a cousin who was born with a jade in his mouth, was exceptionally mischievous, hated studying, and loved to mingle in the inner chambers. His maternal grandmother spoiled him excessively and no one dared to discipline him. Now, hearing what Lady Wang said, she knew they were talking about this cousin. So she laughed and said, ""Is the brother my aunt mentioned the one born with a jade? I also heard my mother often say that this brother is one year older than me, and his nickname is Baoyu. Although he is very naive and mischievous, he is said to be very good among his sisters. Besides, since I'm here, I naturally only stay with my sisters. The brothers are in separate houses and rooms, so how could I bother with them?"" Lady Wang laughed and said, ""You don't know the reason: he is different from others. Since he was a child, he was spoiled by the old lady and was used to being pampered with his sisters. If his sisters ignore him for a day, he is actually quieter. Even if he is upset, he just goes out of the two doors and vents his anger on his two little servants behind their backs, and he is fine after grumbling for a while. But if his sisters talk to him more one day, he is so happy that he causes a lot of trouble. So I advise you not to pay attention to him. He is sweet-talking one moment, cursing the next, and acting crazy and silly the next. Just don't believe him."""
"Daiyu agreed to everything one by one. Just then, a maid came back and forth, saying, ""The old lady has called for dinner."" Lady Wang hurriedly led Daiyu from the back room door, along the back corridor to the west, out of the corner door, which was a wide alley running from south to north. On the south side was a small three-room hall, and on the north side stood a large painted screen, behind which was a half-door and a small room. Lady Wang pointed to it with a smile and said to Daiyu, ""This is your sister Feng's room. When you come back, you can find her here. If you need anything, just tell her."" There were also four or five young boys standing at the gate of the courtyard, all standing ready to serve. Lady Wang then led Daiyu through an east-west corridor, which was the back yard of Grandma Jia."
"Thus, upon entering the inner room, there were already many people serving there. When they saw Madam Wang arrived, they set up the table and chairs. Mrs. Li, the wife of Jia Zhu, served the rice, while Xifeng set the chopsticks, and Madam Wang served the soup. The Dowager Jia was sitting alone on the couch in the middle, with four empty chairs on both sides. Xifeng quickly pulled Daiyu to sit on the first chair on the left, but Daiyu was very modest. The Dowager Jia laughed and said, ""Your aunts and sisters-in-law are not dining here. You are a guest and should sit like this."" Only then did Daiyu take her seat. The Dowager Jia asked Madam Wang to sit down. The three sisters Yingchun, Tanchun, and Xichun took their seats after paying their respects. Yingchun sat on the first chair on the right, Tanchun on the second on the left, and Xichun on the second on the right. The maids on the side were holding dusters, mouth-rinsing bowls, and handkerchiefs. Li and Feng stood by the table and showed their respect. Although there were many maids and daughters-in-law serving in the outer room, not even a cough could be heard."
"After the quiet meal, each maid brought tea on a small tea tray. On that day, Lin Ruhai taught his daughter to cherish blessings and nourish her body, saying that after meals, she should wait until all the rice grains are swallowed before drinking tea, so as not to hurt the spleen and stomach. Today, Daiyu saw that many things here did not conform to the style of her home, so she had to follow and change them one by one, so she took the tea. Seeing that someone brought the mouthwash bowl again, Daiyu also rinsed her mouth in the same way. After washing her hands, she was served tea again, which was the tea to drink. Grandma Jia said: ""You all go, let us talk freely."" When Lady Wang heard this, she quickly got up, made a few casual remarks, and then led Phoenix and Li to leave. Grandma Jia asked Daiyu what book she was reading. Daiyu said: ""I just started reading 'The Four Books'."" Daiyu also asked what books her sisters were reading. Grandma Jia said: ""Whatever book they read, they just recognize a few words. They are not blind with their eyes open!"""
"Before she could finish her sentence, there was a sound of footsteps outside. The maid came in and laughed, ""Baoyu is here!"" Daiyu was wondering in her heart: ""This Baoyu, I don't know what kind of person he is, a naive child? —— It would be better if I didn't see that fool."" As she was thinking, she suddenly saw that the maid had not finished speaking, and a young master had already come in:"
"Wearing a purple-gold crown with hair tied up, and a golden forehead band with two dragons fighting for a pearl across the eyebrows; dressed in a two-tone gold, red robe with hundreds of butterflies and arrow sleeves, tied with a multicolored silk knot with long tassels, covered with a turquoise floral eight-cluster Japanese satin coat; stepping in small court boots with a pink base and green satin. The face is like the moon in mid-autumn, the color is like the flower at dawn in spring, the temples are as if cut with a knife, the eyebrows are like ink paintings, the face is like peach petals, the eyes are like autumn waves. Even when angry, it seems like smiling, even when glaring, it is affectionate. A golden choker with dragon patterns around the neck, and a multicolored silk cord, tied with a piece of beautiful jade."
"Upon seeing him, Daiyu was greatly startled, thinking to herself, ""How strange, he looks so familiar, as if I've seen him somewhere before!"" Baoyu then paid his respects to Grandma Jia, who ordered, ""Go and see your mother."" Baoyu turned around and left. When he returned, he had changed his attire: his short hair around his head was tied into small braids, with red silk at the ends, all gathered at the crown of his head into a large braid, shiny black like lacquer, from the crown to the tip, a string of four large pearls, with a golden eight-treasure pendant; he was wearing a semi-old silver-red flowered jacket, still with a necklace, jade pendant, name lock, amulet and other items; half-exposed were his pine flowered silk trousers, ink-black socks with brocade edges, and thick-soled large red shoes. His face looked as if it was powdered, and his lips as if they were rouged; his eyes were full of emotion, and he was always smiling. His natural charm was all in his eyebrows; all his thoughts and feelings were piled up in the corners of his eyes. His appearance was extremely good, but it was hard to know his true character. Later generations have two poems titled ""West River Moon"" that critique Baoyu very aptly, the poem goes:"
"Seeking sorrow and resentment without reason, sometimes acting foolish and crazy. Even though born with a good appearance, the inside is originally wild. Fallen and ignorant of worldly affairs, stubbornly afraid to read articles. With eccentric behavior and peculiar nature, who cares about the world's slander!"
"Wealth does not know the joy of work, poverty is hard to bear the desolation. It's a pity to waste good times, hopeless for the country and the family. The world's most incapable, unparalleled in ancient and modern times. A message to the rich and the privileged: Do not imitate this child's shape!"
"""Granny Jia laughed and said, 'You've taken off your clothes before the guest has even arrived, go and see your sister!' Baoyu had already noticed an extra sister, so he guessed that she must be the daughter of Aunt Lin, and quickly came to pay his respects. After the greetings were over and he sat down, he took a closer look at her appearance, which was different from everyone else's."""
"Two brows seem to frown but not frown, like smoke, a pair of eyes seem to weep but not weep, containing dew. The demeanor gives birth to sorrow in both cheeks, and the delicate body is stricken with illness. Teardrops are dotted, and the delicate panting is faint. In her quiet moments, she is like a beautiful flower reflecting in the water, and in her actions, she is like a weak willow supporting the wind. Her heart has one more hole than Bi Gan, and her sickness is three times more beautiful than Xi Shi."
"After Baoyu finished reading, he laughed and said, ""I have seen this sister before."" Grandma Jia laughed and said, ""What nonsense are you talking about, when have you ever seen her?"" Baoyu laughed and said, ""Although I have never seen her, I feel like I know her when I see her kind face. Today, let's just treat it as a reunion after a long separation, it's not impossible."" Grandma Jia laughed and said, ""That's even better, if that's the case, you'll get along even better."" Baoyu then walked over and sat next to Daiyu, looked at her carefully, and asked, ""Have you ever studied?"" Daiyu said, ""I haven't studied, I only went to school for a year, and I can recognize a few characters."" Baoyu then asked, ""What are the two characters of your respected name?"" Daiyu then said her name. Baoyu asked for her courtesy name. Daiyu said, ""I don't have one."" Baoyu laughed and said, ""I'll give you a wonderful character, how about 'Pin Pin', it's wonderful."" Tan Chun asked where it came from. Baoyu said, ""It's said in 'The Comprehensive Examination of People from Ancient to Modern Times' that 'There is a stone in the west named Dai, which can replace the ink for drawing eyebrows.' Besides, Sister Lin's eyebrows are slightly frowning, so these two characters are perfect, aren't they?"" Tan Chun laughed and said, ""I'm afraid it's another one of your fabrications."" Baoyu laughed and said, ""Apart from the 'Four Books', there are too many fabrications, why am I the only one who can't make them up?"" He asked Daiyu again, ""Do you also have jade?"" Everyone didn't understand what he meant, Daiyu thought about it because he had jade, so he asked me if I had it or not, so she answered, ""I don't have that. I think that jade is a rare thing, how can everyone have it."""
"Upon hearing this, Baoyu immediately fell into a fit of madness, took off the jade, and threw it away with all his might, cursing, ""What a rare thing, it doesn't even choose the high and low of people, and still talks about 'spiritual communication'! I don't want this laborious thing anymore!"" Everyone was frightened and rushed to pick up the jade. Grandma Jia hugged Baoyu in a hurry and said, ""You troublemaker! If you're angry, it's easy to hit and scold people, why bother throwing away your life root!"" Baoyu, with tears all over his face, sobbed, ""There are no sisters at home, only I have, I say it's boring; now there is no such fairy-like sister, it can be seen that this is not a good thing."" Grandma Jia hurriedly coaxed him, ""Your sister originally had this, because your aunt couldn't bear your sister when she died, and had no way to deal with it, so she took her jade with her: firstly, it was a complete funeral ritual, fulfilling your sister's filial piety; secondly, your aunt's spirit could also be regarded as seeing her daughter. Therefore, she only said that she didn't have this, not to exaggerate herself. How can you compare with her now? You should be careful to wear it on, in case your mother knows."" After saying this, she took it from the maid's hand and put it on him personally. When Baoyu heard this, he thought about it and found it reasonable, so he didn't argue anymore."
"At present, the wet nurse came to ask about Daiyu's room. Grandma Jia said: ""Today, I will move Baoyu out and stay with me in the warm room of the suite, and temporarily place your Miss Lin in the turquoise cabinet. After the harsh winter, we will tidy up their rooms in spring and make another arrangement."" Baoyu said: ""Dear grandma, I am very comfortable on the bed outside the turquoise cabinet, why bother to come out and disturb your peace."" Grandma Jia thought for a while and said: ""Alright then."" Each person had a wet nurse and a maid to take care of them, and the rest were on call outside at night. On one side, Xifeng had already ordered someone to send a lotus-colored flower canopy, along with several pieces of brocade quilts and satin mattresses."
"Daiyu only brought two people with her: one was her childhood nanny, Wang Mom, and the other was a ten-year-old maid, who had also been with her since childhood, named Xueyan. Grandma Jia saw that Xueyan was very young and full of childishness, and Wang Mom was extremely old, so she figured that Daiyu might not be satisfied or feel at ease with them. Therefore, she gave Daiyu one of her second-class maids, named Yingge. In addition, like Yingchun and others, each person, besides their childhood wet nurse, had four other maids for guidance. Apart from the two maids who were in charge of personal belongings and bathing, there were five or six other maids for cleaning and running errands. At that moment, Wang Mom and Yingge were accompanying Daiyu inside the green gauze cabinet. Baoyu's wet nurse, Li Mom, and the head maid named Xiren, were accompanying outside on the large bed."
"Originally, this girl was also a maid of Granny Jia, her real name was Pearl. Granny Jia, because of her deep love for Baoyu, was afraid that Baoyu's maids would not be loyal and diligent. She always liked this girl for her pure heart and dedication to her duties, so she gave her to Baoyu. Baoyu, knowing that her surname was Hua (flower), and having seen the phrase ""the fragrance of flowers overwhelms people"" in an old poem, reported back to Granny Jia and renamed her Xiren (Overwhelms People). Xiren also had some naive aspects: when she served Granny Jia, she only had Granny Jia in her heart and eyes; now serving Baoyu, she only has Baoyu in her heart and eyes. However, because of Baoyu's eccentric personality, he often disregarded her advice, which really made her worry."
"It was late, and Baoyu's nanny Li had already gone to sleep. He saw that Daiyu and Yingge were still not resting inside. He removed his makeup and quietly came in, smiling and asking, ""Miss, why haven't you rested yet?"" Daiyu hurriedly invited, ""Sister, please sit down."" Xiren sat on the edge of the bed. Yingge laughed and said, ""Miss Lin is here grieving, crying and saying, 'I just arrived today and already caused your brother's madness. What if the jade was broken, wouldn't it be my fault!' So she's upset, and I had a hard time comforting her."" Xiren said, ""Miss, don't be like this. There might be even stranger jokes in the future! If you're upset about his behavior, you might not be able to handle it. Don't take it to heart!"" Daiyu said, ""I'll remember what you sisters said. After all, what's the origin of that jade? Are there any inscriptions on it?"" Xiren said, ""Even the whole family doesn't know its origin. There are ready-made holes on it. I heard that it was taken out of his mouth when he was found. I'll bring it to you to see."" Daiyu hurriedly stopped her, ""Forget it, it's late at night. It's not too late to look at it tomorrow."" Everyone chatted for a while before finally resting."
"The next day, after paying respects to Grandma Jia, she went to Lady Wang's place. Lady Wang and Xifeng were reading a letter from Jinling. There were also two daughters-in-law sent by Lady Wang's brother and sister-in-law to chat. Although Daiyu didn't know the details, Tanchun and others knew that they were discussing Xue Pan, the nephew of the Xue family living in Jinling City, who relied on wealth and power, and killed people. He is now under trial in Ying Tianfu. Now that their uncle Wang Ziteng has received the news, he sent people from his family to inform this side, intending to summon him to Beijing."
