"However, Feng Su, upon hearing the summons of the officials, hurriedly came out with a smile to inquire. Those people were just shouting: ""Please bring out Mr. Zhen!"" Feng Su hurriedly replied with a smile: ""My surname is Feng, not Zhen. Only my son-in-law's surname is Zhen, and he has been a monk for one or two years now, I wonder if you are asking for him?"" Those officials said: ""We don't know what's 'true' or 'false', we are here to inquire on the orders of the master, since he is your son-in-law, you should go with us to meet the master in person, to avoid any confusion."" Saying this, they didn't allow Feng Su to say more, and they all pushed him to go. Everyone in the Feng family was panicked, not knowing what was happening."
"That night, around the second watch, Feng Su came back, overjoyed. Everyone hurriedly asked him what happened. He then said, ""It turns out that the newly promoted master of this mansion is named Jia Hua, originally from Huzhou, who once had an acquaintance with my son-in-law. He just passed by our door because he saw our maid Jiaoxing buying thread, so he thought my son-in-law had moved here. I explained everything to him, and the master was quite moved and sighed. He also asked about his granddaughter, and I told him she got lost while watching the lanterns. The master said, 'No worries, I will send people to find her.' After talking for a while, he even gave me two taels of silver when he left."" When Lady Zhen heard this, she couldn't help but feel sad. There was silence for the rest of the night."
"By the next day, Yu Cun had already sent someone to deliver two letters of silver and four pieces of brocade to thank Madam Zhen's family; he also sent a secret letter to Feng Su, asking him to inquire about Madam Zhen's willingness to have Jiao Xing as his second wife. Feng Su was overjoyed and couldn't wait to please him. He persuaded his daughter and sent Jiao Xing over in a small sedan chair at night. Yu Cun was delighted, needless to say, he gave Feng Su a hundred gold as a gift, and thanked Madam Zhen with many gifts, asking her to take good care of Jiao Xing while waiting to find out about his daughter's whereabouts. Feng Su returned home without a word."
"However, it is said that the maid, Jiaoxing, was the one who looked back at Yucun that year. Because of a casual glance, this incident was caused, which was an unexpected coincidence. Who would have thought that her fate would be so changeable, unexpectedly coming to Yucun's side, and within a year, she gave birth to a son; half a year later, Yucun's legal wife suddenly fell ill and passed away, and Yucun then promoted her to the position of the main wife. Indeed, it is:"
A single mistake may make one superior to others.
"As it turned out, after receiving the silver from Shi Yin that year, Yu Cun left for the capital on the 16th day. By the time of the imperial examination, he had unexpectedly achieved great success, becoming a Jinshi (advanced scholar), and was selected into the outer court. He had already been promoted to the position of prefect of the prefecture. Although he was talented and capable, he was somewhat corrupt and cruel; moreover, he was arrogant and looked down on his superiors, causing all the officials to look at him sideways. Within less than a year, his superiors found a loophole and filed a report against him, accusing him of being ""sly and cunning, arbitrarily altering rituals, selling the name of integrity, and secretly associating with the likes of tigers and wolves, causing numerous problems in the local area and unbearable suffering for the people."" The emperor was furious and immediately dismissed him from his post. When the documents from the ministry arrived, all the officials in the prefecture were overjoyed. Although Yu Cun was extremely ashamed in his heart, he showed no resentment on his face and remained cheerful and carefree. After handing over his official duties, he sent the capital and his family members that he had accumulated over the years as an official back to his hometown, arranged everything properly, and then set off on his own to travel and visit the famous sights of the world."
"On that day, I happened to visit Wuyang again, because I heard that this year's salt administration was appointed to Lin Ruohai. Lin Ruohai, with his surname Lin and name Hai, styled himself as Ruohai, was a former scholar who had been promoted to the position of a high-ranking official in the Lantai Temple. He was originally from Suzhou, and now he was appointed as the imperial historian in charge of salt inspection, and he had been in office for more than a month. It turns out that Lin Ruohai's ancestors had once inherited the title of marquis, and by the time of Ruohai, it had been passed down for five generations. Initially, the title was only inherited for three generations, but due to the current emperor's abundant grace and virtue, surpassing previous generations, he was granted an extra generation of inheritance. When it came to Ruohai's father, he inherited another generation; when it came to Ruohai, he came from a scholarly background. Although he came from a noble family, he was also from a scholarly clan. It's a pity that the Lin family's branches are not prosperous, and the descendants are limited. Although there are several branches, they are all from the same clan as Ruohai, and there are no direct descendants. Now Ruohai is already forty years old, and he only has a three-year-old son who unfortunately died last year. Although he has several concubines, he is destined to have no sons, and there is nothing he can do about it. Now only his legal wife, Mrs. Jia, has given birth to a daughter, whose nickname is Daiyu, and she is only five years old. The couple has no sons, so they cherish her like a precious gem, and seeing her intelligence and beauty, they also want her to learn to read and recognize a few characters, just to pretend to have a foster son, to alleviate their sighs of having no children."
"Yucun was feeling a bit under the weather due to the cold wind and was sick in the inn, only gradually recovering after a month. Firstly, he was tired from the journey, and secondly, he was running out of money. He was just looking for a suitable place to rest for a while. Fortunately, he had two old friends living in this area. Hearing that the local government wanted to hire a Western guest, Yucun took advantage of his friends' help to get the job as a means of settling down. The interesting part was that there was only one female student and two maids to accompany her in her studies. This female student was young and extremely frail, with no limit on the amount of work, so it was very easy for him."
"Another year has passed in a blink of an eye, and who would have known that the mother of the female student, Mrs. Jia, would pass away due to illness. The female student served soup and medicine, mourned and grieved, and then planned to leave the academy. Lin Ruhai intended to have his daughter stay and continue her studies, so he kept her. Recently, because the female student was overly grief-stricken, she, who was originally timid and often ill, triggered her old illness and has not been to school for several days. Yu Cun, having nothing to do, would take a leisurely walk after meals whenever the weather was fine."
"On this day, I happened to go outside the city, intending to appreciate the rural scenery. Suddenly, I walked to a place surrounded by mountains and water, with dense forests and bamboo. There was a faint temple, with dilapidated gates and alleys, and decayed walls. There was a plaque in front of the door, with the three characters ""Zhitong Temple"" written on it, and there was an old and broken couplet next to the door, saying:"
"When there's plenty behind, one forgets to hold back; when there's no way ahead, one thinks of turning back."
"Yucun looked at it, thinking: ""Although these two sentences are written in simple language, their meaning is profound. I have visited some famous mountains and temples, but I have never seen these words before. There might be a somersault hidden in them, why not go in and try?"" Thinking this, he walked in, only to see an old monk named Long Zhong cooking porridge. Yucun saw it and didn't care. But when he asked the old monk about the two sentences, the old monk, who was both deaf and confused, with missing teeth and a dull tongue, answered irrelevantly."
"Yucun grew impatient and decided to go out, intending to go to the village tavern to have a few drinks to enhance his rustic pleasure. So, he leisurely walked there. As he was about to enter the tavern, he saw a man from the group of drinking guests stand up and laugh heartily, welcoming him and saying, ""What a coincidence, what a coincidence."" Yucun looked closely and recognized the man as Leng Zixing, a trader in antiques in the capital city, whom he had known from the past. Yucun always admired Leng Zixing as a man of great capability, and Zixing, in turn, respected Yucun for his scholarly reputation. Therefore, the two of them got along very well and had a great rapport."
"Yucun laughed and asked, ""When did you arrive here, brother? I didn't know. It's such a coincidence to meet today."" Zixing said, ""I arrived home at the end of last year, and because I need to go to the capital again, I took this route to visit a humble friend and talk to him. He insisted that I stay for a few more days. I have no urgent matters, so I will stay for a couple of days and leave around mid-month. Today, my humble friend was busy, so I took a leisurely walk here to rest my feet, I didn't expect such a coincidence!"" As he spoke, he invited Yucun to sit with him and ordered more wine and dishes. The two chatted and drank leisurely, talking about what had happened since they last met."
"Yucun asked, ""Is there any news from the capital recently?"" Zixing replied, ""There's no particular news, but there's a minor incident in your esteemed clan."" Yucun laughed, ""There's no one from my clan in the capital, what are you talking about?"" Zixing laughed, ""You share the same surname, aren't you from the same clan?"" Yucun asked whose family it was. Zixing said, ""It's the Rongguo Mansion, the Jia family. Has it tarnished your reputation?"" Yucun laughed, ""So it's them. If we talk about it, there are quite a few people from my humble clan. Since Jia Fu of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the branches have flourished, and there are members in every province. Who can thoroughly investigate it? If we talk about the Rongguo branch, it is indeed from the same genealogy. But their glory is something we can't afford to associate with, so we've become even more distant over time."""
"Zi Xing sighed and said, ""Old sir, don't say that. Nowadays, both Ning and Rong families have become desolate, not like the old days."" Yu Cun said, ""In the past, both Ning and Rong families had a lot of people, how did they become desolate?"" Leng Zi Xing said, ""Exactly, it's a long story."" Yu Cun said, ""Last year I went to Jinling, because I wanted to visit the relics of the Six Dynasties. That day, I entered the Stone City and passed by their old houses. The east of the street is Ning Guo Fu, and the west is Rong Guo Fu, the two houses are connected, occupying most of the street. Although the front door was deserted, looking through the fence, the halls and pavilions inside were still majestic; even the trees and rocks in the garden behind were still lush, how could it look like a declining family?"" Leng Zi Xing laughed and said, ""You are a scholar, but you don't understand! The ancients said, 'A hundred-legged insect, dead but not stiff.' Although it is not as prosperous as before, compared to the average official's family, it still has a different atmosphere. Nowadays, the population is growing, the affairs are increasing, and there are many wealthy and honorable people among the masters and servants, but there is no one who can strategize; the daily expenses cannot be saved, although the outside frame has not fallen yet, the inside bag has also come up. This is a small matter. There is a bigger issue: who would know that such a family of bells and food, and a clan of literature and poetry, the descendants are getting worse with each generation!"" Yu Cun was also surprised and said, ""Such a family of poetry and etiquette, how could they not educate well? I don't know about other families, but these Ning and Rong families are the best at educating their children."""
"Zi Xing sighed and said, ""That's exactly what I was talking about. Let me tell you: Ning Guogong and Rong Guogong were brothers from the same mother. Ning Gong was the elder and had four sons. After Ning Gong's death, Jia Daihua inherited his position and also raised two sons: the elder named Jia Fu, who died when he was eight or nine years old, leaving only the second son, Jia Jing, to inherit the position. Now he is completely obsessed with Taoism, only interested in alchemy, and doesn't care about anything else. Fortunately, he had a son named Jia Zhen in his early years. Because his father was so obsessed with becoming an immortal, he let his son inherit his position. His father didn't want to return to his hometown, but instead stayed outside the city with the Taoists. This Master Zhen had a son who is only sixteen years old this year, named Jia Rong. Now, old Master Jing doesn't care about anything. Master Zhen doesn't want to study, he just enjoys his life, and has turned Ning Guofu upside down, and no one dares to manage him. Now let's talk about Rongfu, the strange thing I mentioned earlier happened here. After Rong Gong's death, his eldest son, Jia Daishan, inherited his position. He also married a lady from the Jinling Shi Hou family, and had two sons: the eldest son, Jia She, and the second son, Jia Zheng. Now Daishan has passed away, and his wife is still alive. The eldest son, Jia She, inherited his position; the second son, Jia Zheng, loved reading since he was a child. His grandparents and father loved him the most. They originally wanted him to make a career in the imperial examination, but when Daishan was dying, he left a will. The emperor, out of sympathy for the deceased minister, immediately asked if there were any other sons. He was immediately introduced and was given an extra official title, and was ordered to study in the department. Now he has been promoted to an assistant minister. The wife of old Master Zheng, Mrs. Wang, gave birth to a son named Jia Zhu in her first pregnancy. He entered school at the age of fourteen, got married and had a child before he was twenty, and then died of an illness. The second child was a daughter, born on the first day of the New Year, which was strange; unexpectedly, the following year she gave birth to a son, which was even stranger. As soon as he was born, he held a piece of colorful and crystal-clear jade in his mouth, with many characters on it, so he was named Baoyu. Isn't that a strange and unusual thing?"""
"Yucun laughed and said, ""Indeed strange. I'm afraid this person is not of small origin."" Zixing sneered, ""Everyone says so, so his grandmother loved him like a treasure. When he was one year old, his father wanted to test his future ambitions, so he placed countless things in the world for him to grab. Who knew he didn't take anything, but only grabbed some rouge and jewelry. His father was furious and said, 'He will be a debauchee in the future!' So he was very displeased. Only the old lady Shi still treated him like her life. It's strange to say that now he is seven or eight years old, although he is extremely naughty, but his cleverness and understanding, a hundred others can't match him. It's also strange to talk about his words, he said, 'Daughters are made of water, men are made of mud. When I see a daughter, I feel refreshed; when I see a man, I feel dirty and smelly.' Do you think it's funny or not? He will undoubtedly be a debauchee in the future!"" Yucun suddenly became serious and quickly stopped him, ""No! It's a pity that you don't know his origin. I guess his father also mistakenly regarded him as a lecher. If you don't read a lot and know things, and have the ability to understand and explore the mysteries, you can't know."""
"Zi Xing saw him speaking so seriously, and hurriedly asked for advice. Yu Cun said: ""Heaven and earth give birth to people, except for the two kinds of great benevolence and great evil, the rest are not much different. If the great benevolent person, then born in response to the trend, the great evil person, then born in response to the catastrophe. The trend gives birth to world peace, and the catastrophe gives birth to world danger. Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, Zhou, Zhao, Kong, Meng, Dong, Han, Zhou, Cheng, Zhang, Zhu, are all born in response to the trend. Chi You, Gong Gong, Jie, Zhou, Qin Shihuang, Wang Mang, Cao Cao, Huan Wen, An Lushan, Qin Hui, etc., are all born in response to the catastrophe. The great benevolent person, governs the world; the great evil person, disrupts the world. Clear and bright, the righteous qi of heaven and earth, is held by the benevolent; cruel and perverse, the evil qi of heaven and earth, is held by the evil. Now in the era of prosperous and everlasting dynasty, the world of peace and inaction, those who hold the clear and bright spirit, from the court to the grassland, are everywhere. The remaining spirit, with nowhere to go, becomes sweet dew, becomes a gentle wind, and irrigates the four seas. The cruel and perverse evil qi, unable to overflow in the bright day, is condensed and blocked in the deep ditch and big ravine. Occasionally due to the wind, or being crushed by the cloud, there is a slight sense of shaking and feeling, a little bit of it is accidentally leaked out, just when the spirit is passing by, the right does not tolerate the evil, and the evil is jealous of the right, the two do not give in to each other, just like wind, water, thunder and lightning, once they meet in the ground, they can neither disappear nor give in, they must fight and explode before they are exhausted. Therefore, its qi must also be given to people, and it will disperse after venting. If men and women happen to be born with this qi, they cannot become benevolent gentlemen in the upper class, nor can they become great evil in the lower class. Among the tens of thousands of people, their smart, clever and spiritual qi is above the tens of thousands of people; their perverse, evil and absurd attitudes that are not close to human feelings are also below the tens of thousands of people. If born in a noble and wealthy family, they will be sentimental; if born in a family of poetry and books, they will be hermits and high people; even if they are born in a poor family, they cannot be runners and strong servants, willing to be driven and controlled by ordinary people, they must be excellent and famous. Like Xu You, Tao Qian, Ruan Ji, Ji Kang, Liu Ling, Wang Xie's two families, Gu Hu Tou, Chen Hou Zhu, Tang Ming Huang, Song Hui Zong, Liu Ting Zhi, Wen Fei Qing, Mi Nan Gong, Shi Man Qing, Liu Qi Qing, Qin Shao You, and recent Ni Yun Lin, Tang Bo Hu, Zhu Zhi Shan, and then like Li Gui Nian, Huang Fan Chuo, Jing Xin Mo, Zhuo Wen Jun, Hong Fu, Xue Tao, Cui Ying, Zhao Yun and others, these are all people who would be the same if they changed places."""
"Zixing said, ""According to you, 'If successful, you're a noble; if failed, you're a thief.' "" Yucun replied, ""Exactly. You may not know that since I resigned from my post, I have traveled around various provinces in the past two years and have encountered two unusual children. Therefore, as soon as you mentioned Baoyu just now, I guessed that he is probably of the same kind. Without going too far, do you know the Zhen family in Jinling City, who is the president of the Jinling Province Benevolent Institution appointed by the imperial court?"" Zixing said, ""Who doesn't know! The Zhen Mansion and the Jia Mansion are old relatives and have been friends for generations. The two families are extremely close. I have also been interacting with their family for more than a day."""
"Yucun laughed and said, ""Last year when I was in Jinling, someone recommended me to tutor at the Zhen family. I went in to see the situation, and who knew that their family was so prestigious, it was a wealthy and courteous family, which was a rare place to tutor. But this one student, although he was just starting to learn, was more troublesome than one preparing for official exams. It's even more ridiculous when he said, 'I can only recognize characters and understand them when I have two daughters accompanying me to study, otherwise I would be confused.' He often told his servants, 'The two characters for 'daughter' are extremely noble and pure, even more honorable than the names of Amitabha and Yuanshi Tianzun! You guys with your dirty mouths and stinky tongues, must not disrespect these two characters. Whenever you want to say it, you must rinse your mouth with clean water or fragrant tea first; if you make a mistake, you will be severely punished.' His tyranny, impatience, stubbornness, and stupidity were all extraordinary. As soon as he finished his studies and went in to see those daughters, he became gentle, peaceful, intelligent, and elegant, like a completely different person. Therefore, his father had severely punished him several times, but he just couldn't change. Every time he was beaten and couldn't bear the pain, he would start shouting 'sister'. Later, I heard the daughters inside making fun of him: 'Why do you keep calling 'sister' when you're beaten? Are you asking your sisters to plead for mercy? Aren't you ashamed?' His answer was the most interesting. He said, 'When I'm in severe pain, I just call out 'sister', maybe it can relieve the pain, because after I call out, I really feel less pain, so I got the secret: whenever the pain is extreme, I just start calling 'sister'. Isn't it funny? Also because of the grandmother's blind doting, every time the grandson insulted the teacher and blamed the son, so I resigned and left. Now I'm tutoring at the family of the Imperial Censor Lin who supervises the salt. You see, such a child will definitely not be able to maintain the foundation of his grandfather and follow the advice of his teachers. It's just a pity that all the sisters in his family are rare."""
"Zixing said, ""Even in the Jia Mansion, the current three are not bad. The eldest daughter of the political father, named Yuan Chun, is now selected into the palace because of her virtuous, filial, talented and moral character. The second young lady is from the concubine of the pardon father, named Ying Chun; the third young lady is the illegitimate daughter of the political father, named Tan Chun; the fourth young lady is the biological sister of Master Zhen from Ning Mansion, named Xichun. Because the old lady Shi loves her granddaughters very much, they all study with their grandmother, and they are all not bad."" Yucun said, ""What's more wonderful is the custom of the Zhen family. The names of the daughters are also named after the names of the men, unlike other families that use these 'spring', 'red', 'fragrance', 'jade' and other glamorous words. How did the Jia Mansion fall into this stereotype?"" Zixing said, ""No. It's just because the current eldest lady was born on the first day of the first month, so she was named Yuan Chun, and the rest followed the word 'Chun'. The previous generation was also from brothers. There is now evidence: the wife of your current master Lin, who is the biological sister of the two publics of Rong Mansion, was named Jia Min when she was at home. If you don't believe it, you can find out when you go back."" Yucun slapped the case and laughed, ""No wonder this female student reads the word 'min' as 'mi' in every book, and every time she writes the word 'min', she reduces one or two strokes, I have some doubts in my heart. Now that I hear you say it, it's undoubtedly for this. No wonder my female student's speech and behavior are different, not the same as the recent women, I think her mother must be extraordinary, so she can have her daughter, now I know she is the granddaughter of Rong Mansion, it's not surprising, but it's a pity that she died last month."" Zixing sighed, ""Of the four old sisters, this one is the smallest and is gone. The older sisters, none of them are left. Just look at this younger generation, what will the future marriage bed be like?"""
"Yucun said, ""Exactly. Speaking of this government official, he already has a son who holds a jade, and also a weak grandson left by his eldest son. Is there no one in this amnesty who is not successful?"" Zixing said, ""Since the official has a descendant of the jade son, his concubine has given birth to another one, but I don't know its pros and cons. There are currently two sons and one grandson, but I don't know what will happen in the future. If you ask that amnesty official, he also has two sons, the elder named Jia Lian, who is already in his twenties, and his wife is the niece of the official's wife, Wang. They have been married for two years. This Mr. Lian, who is currently a Tongzhi, is also unwilling to study. He is good at adapting to the world and speaks well, so he now lives in his uncle's house and helps with some housework. Who knew that after he married his wife, everyone praised his wife, and Mr. Lian fell back a bit: they say she is extremely beautiful, speaks clearly, and is very cunning, she is indeed a man who is incomparable."""
"After hearing this, Yu Cun laughed and said, ""You see, my previous words were not wrong. The few people we were just talking about, I'm afraid they are all people who have both righteousness and evil in them, but it's hard to tell."" Zi Xing said, ""Whether they are evil or righteous, you are always busy calculating others' business, you should have a drink too."" Yu Cun said, ""Exactly, I've been so busy talking that I've had a few more drinks."" Zi Xing laughed and said, ""Talking about others' affairs is a good way to enjoy the wine, so what's the harm in having a few more drinks?"" Yu Cun looked out the window and said, ""It's getting late, they must have closed the city gates. We can slowly enter the city and continue our conversation, there's no rush."" So, the two of them got up and settled the bill for the wine. Just as they were about to leave, they heard someone calling from behind, ""Brother Yu Cun, congratulations! I came especially to bring you some good news."" When Yu Cun turned around to look-"
