"This is the first chapter of the book. The author says: After experiencing a dream, I hide the truth and use the concept of ""clairvoyance"" to write this book ""The Story of the Stone"". Hence, it is called ""Zhen ShiYin"" and so on. But what and who are recorded in the book? I also say: ""Now I am busy with nothing accomplished, suddenly thinking of all the women in the past, I carefully compare each one, and find that their behavior and knowledge are all above me. Why am I, a man, not as good as them? I am really ashamed, and regret is useless on such a day! At this time, I want to compile a collection to tell the world: My sin is inevitable, but there are always people in the boudoir, and it is absolutely impossible to protect myself because of my incompetence, and let them all disappear. Even today's thatched roof and straw window, clay stove and rope bed, the morning and evening wind and dew, the willow in the steps and the flowers in the courtyard, have not hindered my writing. Although I am uneducated and can't write, why not use colloquial language to perform a story, which can also make the boudoir known, please the world's eyes, and break people's sadness, isn't it appropriate?"" Hence, it is called ""Jia YuCun"" and so on."
"The use of words like ""dream"" and ""illusion"" in this return is to remind readers visually, and it is also the original intention of this book."
"Dear readers, you may wonder where this book comes from? Although the origin may seem absurd at first glance, it is deeply interesting upon closer inspection. Let me clarify its history to dispel any doubts for the readers."
"It turns out that when Nuwa was refining stones to mend the sky, she created 36,501 stubborn stones, each twelve feet high and twenty-four feet square, at the Wujie Cliff of Dahuang Mountain. Nuwa used only 36,500 pieces, leaving one unused, which was discarded at the foot of Qinggeng Peak of this mountain. Who knew that after this stone was refined, it became spiritually aware. Seeing that all the other stones were used to mend the sky, but it was not chosen due to its lack of quality, it felt resentment and regret, lamenting and feeling ashamed day and night."
"One day, during a moment of lament, a monk and a Taoist priest were seen approaching from afar. They were extraordinary in appearance, with a unique aura about them. They chatted and laughed as they arrived at the foot of the mountain, sitting by a stone and engaging in lively discussion. They first talked about the mystical tales of immortals in the clouds and foggy seas, then they shifted to the glory and wealth of the mortal world. The stone, upon hearing this, was moved and desired to experience this glory and wealth in the human world. However, it was aware of its own dullness and had no choice but to speak in human language to the monk and the Taoist priest: ""Masters, I am a dull creature and cannot pay my respects properly. I heard you talking about the glory and prosperity of the human world and I deeply yearn for it. Although I am dull in nature, I have some understanding. Seeing your immortal-like appearances, I believe you are not ordinary beings, but possess the ability to aid the world and benefit mankind. If you could show a bit of compassion and take me into the mortal world, to enjoy a few years in the realm of wealth and the land of tenderness, I would be forever grateful and never forget your kindness."" The two masters listened and laughed heartily, saying: ""Well said, well said! There are indeed some pleasures in the mortal world, but they cannot be relied upon forever. Moreover, there are the eight words 'Not enough in beauty, many demons in good things' closely related, in an instant, joy turns into sorrow, people and things change, in the end, it is all but a dream, all realms return to emptiness, it might be better not to go."""
"Shi Fanxin was already burning with desire, and he couldn't hear any dissuasion. He pleaded again and again. The two immortals knew they couldn't force him, so they sighed and said, ""This is also the number of things that come from nothing when calmness reaches its extreme and thoughts start to move. Since this is the case, we will take you to enjoy the pleasures, but when you are not satisfied, don't regret it."" Shi said, ""Of course, of course."" The monk added, ""If you say you are spiritual, but you are so dull and there is nothing extraordinary about you. In this case, you can only stand on tiptoe. Well, I will now greatly assist you with the Buddha's law, and when the catastrophe is over, I will return to my nature to close this case. Is that okay with you?"" Shi was grateful upon hearing this. The monk then chanted a spell, displayed a great illusion, and instantly transformed a large stone into a bright and clean beautiful jade, and also shrunk it to the size of a fan pendant that can be worn or held. The monk held it in his palm and laughed, ""The shape is indeed a treasure! But there is no real benefit, you need to engrave more numbers on it, so that people can see it is a wonder at first sight. Then I will take you to the prosperous and flourishing country, the family of poetry and etiquette, the place where flowers and willows are prosperous, and the hometown of gentleness and wealth to settle down and enjoy your work."" Shi was so happy that he couldn't help himself, so he asked, ""I don't know what kind of wonders you have given me, and I don't know where you are taking me? I hope you can tell me clearly, so I won't be confused."" The monk laughed and said, ""Don't ask, you will understand in the future."" After saying that, he put the stone in his sleeve, and he and the Taoist floated away, not knowing where they were going."
"Later, after who knows how many lifetimes and calamities, a Taoist named Kong Kong came seeking immortality. He happened to pass by the foot of Qinggeng Peak in the vast wilderness of Wuji Cliff. Suddenly, he saw clear inscriptions on a large stone, recounting a vivid story. Kong Kong the Taoist started to read from the beginning. It turned out to be a tale of a talentless being mending the sky, transforming into human form, and being led into the mortal world by the vast and vague Great Master and the distant True Man. They experienced all the joys and sorrows, separations and reunions, and the warmth and coldness of the world. There was also a verse at the end:"
"No material can mend the vast sky, vainly entering the mortal world for so many years. These are matters of past and future lives, who can record them into a remarkable tale?"
"The place after the poem is where this stone fell, where it was reincarnated, a story of old traces personally experienced. Among them, family trivial matters and leisurely poetry are all available, which may be interesting and relieving; however, the age of the dynasty and the geography of the country are lost without examination."
"Kong Kong Daoist then said to the stone, ""Brother Stone, this story of yours, according to your own words, has some interest, so I have written it here, intending to ask the world for a legend. In my opinion, the first thing is that there is no age to be considered; the second thing is that there are no great virtues or great loyalties to govern the court and the customs, and there are only a few different women in it, either emotional or foolish, or small talents and minor virtues, and there are no virtues of Ban Gu and Cai Nu. I'm afraid people won't like to read it even if I copy it."" The stone laughed and replied, ""Why is my master so foolish! If there is no age to be considered, why not just borrow the ages of Han and Tang dynasties to embellish it? But I think that all the wild histories have followed the same path, and it is more novel and unique not to borrow this set. It's just about the matter, the reason, and the principle, so why bother with the age and the dynasty! Moreover, there are very few common people in the market who like to read books about governance, and there are many who love to read leisurely articles. In the past, wild histories either slandered the monarch and the minister, or belittled the wife and daughter, and there were countless crimes of adultery and evil. There is also a kind of wind and moon ink, which is obscene and stinky, and the butcher's ink is harmful to people's children, and there are countless. As for the books of beautiful women and talented men, they all come out of the same set, and they can't help but involve in licentiousness, so that the whole paper is full of Pan An, Zi Jian, Xi Zi, Wen Jun, but the author wants to write his own two love poems and odes, so he has to make up the names of a man and a woman, and he has to come out with a small person in the middle to stir up trouble, just like a clown in a play. And the maidservants open their mouths and say, ""It's not literature, it's reason."" So if you look at them one by one, they are all self-contradictory and unreasonable, and they are not as good as the few women I have seen and heard in half of my life. Although I dare not say that they are stronger than the people in the books of the previous generations, but their deeds and origins can also relieve boredom and break boredom; there are also a few crooked poems and familiar words that can be used to spray rice and wine. As for the separation and reunion, the ups and downs, then follow the traces and don't dare to add any carving, just for the sake of people's eyes and lose the true transmission. Nowadays, the poor are burdened by food and clothing every day, and the rich are always unsatisfied. Even if they have a little leisure time, they have the affairs of greed and lust, love of goods and worry. Where can they have the time to read the books of governance? So I don't want people to praise this story of mine, and I don't necessarily want people to read it with pleasure. I just want them to play with it when they are drunk and full, or when they are avoiding things and getting rid of their worries. Isn't it saving some life and strength? Compared with the pursuit of emptiness and delusion, it also saves the harm of gossip and the pain of running around. Moreover, it also allows people to change their eyes and not compare with those who are confused and meet, full of talented women, Zi Jian Wen Jun Hong Niang Xiao Yu and other common old manuscripts. What does my master think?"""
"After hearing such words, Kong Kong Daoist thought for a while, and reviewed ""The Stone Record"" again. He found that although there were some words criticizing the wicked and punishing the evil, it was not meant to insult the times or the world. When it comes to the virtues of a good ruler, loyal ministers, loving fathers, and filial sons, all related to moral norms, it is full of praises and endless admiration, which is incomparable to other books. Although the main theme of the book is about love, it is just a true record of events, not a false exaggeration, and it is not comparable to those that purely invite lust and make secret agreements. Because it does not interfere with the times, it was transcribed from beginning to end, and it became a legendary story. Since then, Kong Kong Daoist, affected by the emotions in the story, changed his name to ""Monk of Love"", and renamed ""The Stone Record"" to ""Monk of Love Record"". Dong Lu Kong Mei Xi titled it ""The Precious Mirror of Wind and Moon"". Later, because Cao Xueqin read it in the Mourning Red Pavilion for ten years, revised it five times, compiled a catalogue, divided it into chapters and episodes, it was titled ""The Twelve Beauties of Jinling"". And a quatrain was titled:"
"Absurd words fill the paper, with a handful of bitter tears. All say the author is foolish, who can understand the taste within!"
"When it comes out, it is clear. Let's see what story is on the stone. According to the book on the stone, it says:"
"On the day when the land subsided to the southeast, there was a place in the southeast corner called Gusu, and a city called Changmen, which was the top-notch place for wealth and romance in the world. Outside Changmen, there was a ten-mile street, and inside the street, there was a lane called Renqing Lane. In the lane, there was an ancient temple. Because the place was narrow, people all called it Gourd Temple. Next to the temple lived a local official family, whose surname was Zhen, first name was Fei, and courtesy name was Shi Yin. His legal wife, Mrs. Feng, was virtuous and deeply understood etiquette. Although the family was not very rich, the local people regarded them as a prestigious family. Because Zhen Shi Yin was naturally indifferent and did not care about fame and fortune, he spent every day enjoying flowers, cultivating bamboo, drinking wine, and chanting poems, which was indeed a fairy-like character. The only deficiency was that he was already fifty years old and had no son, only a daughter, whose milk name was Yinglian, and she was only three years old."
"One day, in the perpetual daylight of a hot summer, Shi Yin was idly sitting in his study. When his hand grew tired, he threw down his book and rested his head on the table, unknowingly falling asleep. He dreamt that he was in an indistinguishable place. Suddenly, from a distance, a monk and a Taoist priest appeared, walking and talking."
"Only heard the Taoist asked: ""What are you going to do with this foolish thing?"" The monk laughed: ""Don't worry, there is now a romantic case that should be settled, and these romantic enemies have not yet been reincarnated. Taking this opportunity, I will bring this foolish thing with me to let him experience it."" The Taoist said: ""So the romantic grievances will be reincarnated in the near future? But I don't know where it will fall?"" The monk laughed: ""This is funny to say, it is a rare thing that has never been heard in ancient times. Just because there is a red pearl grass on the bank of the Ling River in the west, there is a god Ying attendant who waters it with sweet dew every day, so that this red pearl grass can last for a long time. Later, after receiving the essence of heaven and earth, and being nourished by rain and dew, it finally got rid of the grass and wood and became a human form, only to become a female body, wandering outside the sky of regret all day, eating honey green fruit when hungry, and drinking sorrow sea water when thirsty. Just because the kindness of watering has not been repaid, there is a lingering feeling in her heart. Recently, this god Ying attendant's worldly heart is occasionally burning, taking advantage of this prosperous and peaceful dynasty, intending to descend to the world to create a phantom fate, and has already registered in front of the fairy of the phantom. The phantom fairy also asked, the love of watering has not been repaid, it is better to settle it at this time. The red pearl fairy said: 'He is the grace of sweet dew, and I don't have this water to return. Since he is going to be a man, I will also go down to be a human. I will give him all the tears of my life, and that will be enough to repay him.' Because of this, it has attracted many romantic enemies to settle this case with them."""
"The Taoist said, ""That's indeed rare. I've never heard of the concept of returning tears. I suppose this story is even more trivial and delicate than the usual tales of romance."" The monk replied, ""The usual romantic figures are only known for their general deeds and poetic works; the details of their daily lives within their households, such as their meals, are never recorded. Furthermore, most romantic tales only involve stealing affections, secret rendezvous, and elopements, without truly expressing the genuine feelings of love. I believe that these people entering the world, whether they are infatuated, virtuous, foolish or unworthy, are all different from those described by the ancients."" The Taoist said, ""Why don't we take this opportunity to go down to the world and save a few souls? Wouldn't that be a great merit?"" The monk said, ""That's exactly what I have in mind. You come with me to the palace of the Fairy of Alert Illusion, to settle the handover of the foolish beings. After these romantic sinners have reincarnated, we can go. Although half of them have already descended to the mortal world, they are not yet all gathered."" The Taoist said, ""If that's the case, I'll go with you."""
"Zhen Shi Yin understood everything, but he didn't know what the ""foolish thing"" was. So he couldn't help but step forward to pay his respects and asked with a smile, ""May I ask the two immortals?"" The monk and Taoist also hurriedly returned the courtesy. Shi Yin then said, ""I just heard the immortals discussing karma, which is rarely heard in the world. But I am ignorant and cannot fully understand. If you could enlighten me, I will listen carefully and may be able to avoid the suffering of sinking."" The two immortals laughed and said, ""This is a mystery that cannot be revealed in advance. When the time comes, don't forget us two, and you can jump out of the fire pit."" After hearing this, Shi Yin didn't ask any more. He laughed and said, ""The mystery cannot be revealed in advance, but you just mentioned a 'foolish thing', I don't know why, can I see it?"" The monk and Taoist said, ""If you ask about this thing, there is a connection."" After saying that, they took it out and handed it to Shi Yin."
"When Shi Yin took a look, it turned out to be a piece of vivid and beautiful jade, with clear inscriptions on it, engraved with the four characters ""Tong Ling Bao Yu"", and there were a few lines of small characters on the back. Just as he was about to take a closer look, the monk said that they had arrived at the illusionary realm, and forcibly snatched it from his hand, and went through a large stone archway with the Taoist, with four big characters written on it, which was ""Tai Xu Huan Jing"". There was also a couplet on both sides, which said:"
"When the false is taken for real, the real becomes false; where nothing becomes something, something returns to nothing."
"Shi Yin was about to follow them, but as he was about to take a step, he suddenly heard a thunderbolt, as if a mountain was collapsing and the earth was sinking. Shi Yin shouted out loud, and when he looked closely, he saw the scorching sun and the slowly waving banana leaves, and he had forgotten most of what he had dreamed about. He also saw the wet nurse coming with Ying Lian. Shi Yin saw that his daughter was becoming more and more beautifully dressed, pleasing and adorable, so he reached out to take her, held her in his arms, played with her for a while, and then took her to the front of the street to watch the bustling festival."
"When Fang was about to come in, he saw a monk and a Taoist coming from the other side: the monk was bald and barefoot, the Taoist was lame and unkempt, acting crazy and talking and laughing. When they arrived at his door and saw Shi Yin holding Ying Lian, the monk began to cry and said to Shi Yin, ""Benefactor, why are you holding this creature with a life but no luck, which will bring trouble to its parents?"" Shi Yin heard this and knew it was nonsense, so he ignored him. The monk still said, ""Let me go, let me go!"" Shi Yin got impatient, so he held his daughter and was about to go in, but the monk pointed at him and laughed, and recited four lines of verse."
"Accustomed to pampering and spoiling, they laugh at your foolishness. The water chestnut flowers are empty against the snow. It's best to guard against the time after the Lantern Festival, for that is when the smoke disappears and the fire extinguishes."
"Shi Yin understood clearly, but hesitated in his heart, intending to ask about their origins. He only heard the Taoist say: ""You and I need not travel together, let's part ways here and each go about our own business. Three calamities later, I will wait for you on Mount Beimang, and when we are all gathered, we will go to the realm of Taixu to retire our identities."" The monk said, ""Most excellent, most excellent!"" After saying this, the two of them left and no trace of them was seen again. At this time, Shi Yin was thinking to himself: These two people must have a story, I should have tried to ask, but now it's too late for regrets."
"Shi Yin was lost in thought when he suddenly saw a poor scholar who lived in the gourd temple next door came out. His name was Jia Hua, styled Biao Shi Fei, and also known as Yu Cun. This Jia Yu Cun was originally from Huzhou, and he was also from a family of scholars and officials. However, he was born in the end times, his parents and ancestors had exhausted their resources, and his family was in decline, leaving only him. He gained nothing in his hometown, so he went to the capital to seek fame and fortune, and to rebuild his family's foundation. Since he came here last year, he has been stranded and temporarily settled in the temple. He makes a living by selling his writings every day, so Shi Yin often interacts with him."
"When Rongguo saw Shi Yin, he quickly paid his respects and said with a smile, ""Old gentleman, you're standing at the door, is there any news from the market?"" Shi Yin laughed and said, ""Not at all. I just brought my daughter out to play because she was crying. It's really boring. Your arrival is just right. Please come in for a chat. We can both kill time."" Saying this, he sent his daughter inside and went to the study with Rongguo. A servant served tea. They had just started talking when a servant rushed in to report, ""Master Yan is here to visit."" Shi Yin quickly stood up and apologized, ""Please forgive my rudeness. Please wait a moment, I will be right back."" Rongguo also stood up and said, ""Please go ahead, sir. I'm a regular guest here, I don't mind waiting."" With that, Shi Yin had already left for the front hall."
"Here in the rain village, he distracted himself by flipping through books. Suddenly, he heard a woman's cough outside the window. Rain Village then got up and looked out the window, it turned out to be a maid, picking flowers there. She was not ordinary in appearance, with clear eyebrows and eyes. Although she was not extremely beautiful, she was still attractive. Rain Village was unconsciously stunned by the sight."
"The maid from the Zhen family picked some flowers and was about to leave when she suddenly looked up and saw someone inside the window. He was dressed in worn-out clothes, though poor, he was robust with a broad face and square mouth, coupled with sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes, a straight nose and prominent cheeks. The maid quickly turned around to avoid him, thinking to herself: ""This man is so robust yet so ragged, he must be the Jia Yucun that my master often talks about, always intending to help but never having the chance. Our family has no such poor relatives or friends, it must be him without a doubt. No wonder they say he is not a man who has been in hardship for long."" With these thoughts, she couldn't help but look back twice."
"When Yucun saw him turn his head, he thought that this woman had feelings for him, and he was overjoyed, thinking that this woman must be a hero with a keen eye, a confidant in the world of turmoil. A child came in for a moment, and Yucun learned that there was a meal waiting for him, so he couldn't stay for long, so he left through the alley. When Shi Yin's guests had left, knowing that Yucun was free, he did not invite him again."
"One day, it was the Mid-Autumn Festival again. After the feast at Shi Yin's house was over, he prepared another feast in the study, but he himself walked to the temple to invite Yu Cun. It turned out that since the day Yu Cun saw the maid of the Zhen family glanced back at him twice, he regarded her as a confidant and always kept her in his mind. Today is also the Mid-Autumn Festival, so he can't help but feel emotional towards the moon, so he recites a five-character quatrain:"
"The future is yet to be divined, adding sorrow frequently. When gloomy, the brow is furrowed; how many times to look back when leaving? Self-reflecting in the wind, who can bear to be a companion under the moon? If the moonlight has intention, it first ascends the jade tower."
"After Yucun finished chanting, he thought of his lifelong ambitions, which were frustrated by the lack of opportunity. He scratched his head and sighed deeply towards the sky, then chanted another verse, saying:"
"The jade seeks a good price within the stone, the hairpin awaits its time to fly within the box."
"Just as Shi Yin came by and heard, he laughed and said, ""Brother Yu Cun, you really have great ambitions!"" Yu Cun quickly laughed and said, ""I'm just casually reciting the lines of the ancients, how dare I be so presumptuous."" He then asked, ""What brings the old gentleman here?"" Shi Yin laughed and said, ""Tonight is the Mid-Autumn Festival, commonly known as the 'Festival of Reunion'. I thought that you, my esteemed brother, might feel a bit lonely staying in the monk's room, so I prepared a little drink and invited you to my humble abode for a drink. I wonder if you would accept my invitation?"" Upon hearing this, Yu Cun did not refuse, but laughed and said, ""Since I am so kindly invited, how dare I reject such a generous offer."" With that, he went back to the academy with Shi Yin."
"After a moment of tea, the cups and plates were already set, not to mention the fine wine and delicious food. The two returned to their seats, first savoring and drinking leisurely, then gradually engaging in deep conversation, unconsciously starting to toast each other. At that time, every household in the neighborhood was filled with the sound of flutes and songs, and a bright moon was overhead, its colorful light condensed. The two became even more cheerful, and the wine flowed freely. At this point, Yu Cun was already somewhat drunk, unable to contain his wild joy, he expressed his feelings to the moon, and recited a verse:"
"When the moon is full, reunion is upon us, its radiant light guarding the jade railing. As the moon is presented in the sky, all the people on earth look up to admire."
"Upon hearing this, Shi Yin exclaimed, ""Wonderful! I've always said that you are not meant to be beneath others for long. The verses you just recited show signs of soaring high. Soon, you will be able to step on the clouds and rainbows. Congratulations, congratulations!"" He personally poured a toast in celebration. Yu Cun, after drinking, sighed, ""It's not just drunken ramblings. If we're talking about the current trends in learning, I might be able to make a name for myself. But right now, I have no money for travel expenses, and the capital is far away. I can't rely on selling my writings to get there."" Before he could finish, Shi Yin interrupted, ""Why didn't you say so earlier? I've always wanted to help, but you never mentioned it, so I didn't dare to impose. Now that it's come to this, even though I'm not talented, I still understand the words 'righteousness' and 'benefit'. Besides, next year is the imperial examination. You should hurry to the capital and show your learning. I will take care of the rest of the expenses, so as not to waste your talent!"" He immediately ordered his servant to bring fifty taels of silver and two sets of winter clothes. He added, ""The 19th is an auspicious day. You can buy a boat and head west. We can meet again next winter after your success. Wouldn't that be wonderful?"" Yu Cun accepted the silver and clothes, thanked him briefly without making a fuss, and continued to drink and chat. They didn't part until the third watch of the night."
"After Shi Yin sent Yu Cun away, he returned to his room and slept until the sun was high in the sky. Thinking about the events of the previous night, he wanted to write two more recommendation letters for Yu Cun to take to the capital, so that Yu Cun could find a place to stay in the house of a government official. However, when he sent someone to deliver the letters, the servant returned and said, ""The monk said that Master Jia has already left for the capital at the fifth watch of the day, and he also left a message for the master, saying 'Scholars are not concerned with auspicious or inauspicious days, but with reason and principle. I'm sorry I couldn't say goodbye in person.'"" Upon hearing this, Shi Yin had no choice but to give up."
"Time flies easily when one is idle, and before you know it, it's the Lantern Festival again. Shi Yin ordered his servant Huo Qi to take Ying Lian to watch the lantern show and the local opera. In the middle of the night, Huo Qi had to relieve himself, so he left Ying Lian sitting on the doorstep of a house. When he came back from the restroom, Ying Lian was nowhere to be found. Huo Qi searched anxiously for half the night and when dawn broke without any sign of Ying Lian, he didn't dare to return to his master, so he fled to another place. Shi Yin and his wife, realizing that their daughter hadn't returned all night, knew something was wrong. They sent several people to look for her, but all returned saying there was no trace of her. The couple, who had only this daughter in their half-life, were distraught at her sudden disappearance. As a result, they wept day and night, almost seeking death. As the days turned into a month, Shi Yin fell ill first; at the same time, his wife also fell ill due to the anxiety over their missing daughter, and had to seek medical treatment every day."
"On the fifteenth of March, there was a mishap in the gourd temple where offerings were being fried. The monks were careless, causing the oil pot to catch fire, which then ignited the window paper. Many houses in this area were made of bamboo and wood, and due to fate, the fire spread from one to another, engulfing the entire street like a mountain of flames. Although soldiers and civilians came to help, the fire had already grown too fierce to be extinguished. It burned all night before gradually dying out, and it was unclear how many houses had been destroyed. It was pitiful that the Zhen family's house next door had been reduced to a field of rubble. Only the couple and a few family members were unharmed. Shi Yin was so distressed that he could only stamp his feet and sigh. He had no choice but to discuss with his wife about moving to their country estate for shelter. However, in recent years, due to floods and droughts, and the rise of thieves and bandits who were seizing land and stealing, the people were not living in peace. As a result, the government was hunting down these criminals, making it difficult to find a safe place. Shi Yin had no choice but to sell off his country estate, and then took his wife and two maids to his father-in-law's house."
"His father-in-law's name was Feng Su, originally from Da Ru Zhou. Although he was a farmer, his family was still affluent. Seeing his son-in-law in such a plight, he was somewhat displeased. Fortunately, Shi Yin still had some money left from selling his fields, which he gave to Feng Su to buy some land and houses at a low price for future livelihood. Feng Su, half coaxing and half profiting, gave him some poor fields and dilapidated houses. Shi Yin, being a scholar, was not accustomed to farming and other such matters. He managed to get by for a year or two, but found himself becoming poorer. Every time Feng Su saw him, he would make some ready-made remarks, and complained both in front and behind that they were not good at living, only good at eating and being lazy. Knowing that he was not well-received, Shi Yin couldn't help but regret and resent. Coupled with the shock and anger of the previous year, he already had accumulated injuries. As an old man, he was attacked by poverty and illness, and gradually began to show signs of his impending death."
"Coincidentally, on this day, when I hobbled to the front of the street with a crutch to distract myself, I suddenly saw a lame Taoist coming from the other side. He was mad and disheveled, wearing hemp shoes and quail clothes, muttering a few words in his mouth, saying:"
"Everyone knows that immortality is good, but they can't forget about fame and success! Where are the generals and ministers of the past and present? A grave mound is now covered with grass. Everyone knows that immortality is good, but they can't forget about gold and silver! All day long, they only regret not having enough, and when they have a lot, their eyes are closed. Everyone knows that immortality is good, but they can't forget about their beautiful wives! You speak of your gratitude every day when you are alive, but when you die, you follow others. Everyone knows that immortality is good, but they can't forget about their children and grandchildren! There have been many foolish parents since ancient times, but who has seen filial children and grandchildren?"
"Shi Yin heard this and came forward, saying, ""What are you talking about? I only heard 'good' and 'done'."" The Taoist laughed and said, ""If you can hear the words 'good' and 'done', you are quite insightful. You should know that in the world, 'good' means 'done', and 'done' means 'good'. If it's not done, it's not good; if you want it to be good, it must be done. This song of mine is called 'The Song of Done and Good'."" Shi Yin, who was wise, had already understood this upon hearing it. He laughed and said, ""Wait! How about I interpret your 'The Song of Done and Good'?"" The Taoist laughed and said, ""You interpret, you interpret."" Then Shi Yin said:"
"The humble room is empty, once filled with tablets; the grass is withered, once a stage for singing and dancing. Spider webs cover the carved beams, and green gauze is pasted on the window again. What about the rich rouge and fragrant powder, how did the temples turn gray? Yesterday, white bones were sent off on the loess ridge, tonight, mandarin ducks lie under the red lantern. Gold fills the box, silver fills the box, and beggars are everywhere to be seen. While lamenting the short life of others, who knew that one would return in mourning! Discipline is important, but who knows if it will become a burden in the future. Choosing the best, who would expect to end up in the alley of fireworks! Because of the dislike for the small official hat, one ends up carrying the yoke; yesterday pitying the cold of the torn jacket, today disliking the length of the purple python: in the chaos, you finish singing and I take the stage, mistaking other places for home. How absurd, in the end, all is for others to wear wedding clothes!"
"Upon hearing this, the mad and lame Taoist clapped his hands and laughed, saying, ""Well understood, well understood!"" Shi Yin then said, ""Let's go!"" He grabbed the bundle from the Taoist's shoulder and carried it himself. Without returning home, he left with the mad Taoist, causing a stir among the neighbors. The news spread like wildfire. Upon hearing this, Feng's wife was so distraught that she was beside herself with grief. She had no choice but to discuss with her father and send people to search everywhere, but to no avail. Helplessly, she had to rely on her parents for support. Fortunately, she still had two old maidservants by her side. The three of them worked day and night, doing some needlework for sale to help support her father. Although Feng Su complained every day, there was nothing he could do."
"On this day, the head maid of the Zhen family was buying thread at the front door, when she suddenly heard a voice shouting in the street. Everyone was saying that the new master had taken office. The maid then hid inside the door to watch, and saw the military prison runners, passing by in pairs, and then a large sedan chair carrying an official in a black hat and red robe passed by. The maid was taken aback, thinking to herself that the official had a kind face, and seemed familiar. She then went into the room and put it out of her mind. In the evening, just as she was about to rest, she suddenly heard a loud knocking on the door, and many people were shouting, ""The master of this mansion has sent someone to summon someone for questioning."" Feng Su was startled, his eyes wide and his mouth agape, not knowing what disaster had befallen, and we'll find out in the next episode."
