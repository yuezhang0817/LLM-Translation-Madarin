From Xi'an to Astana: China-Central Asia cooperation forges ahead with steady strides: Global Times editorial
"Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the second China-Central Asia Summit in Astana from June 16 to 18 at the invitation of President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. During the summit, President Xi will exchange views with the leaders of Central Asian countries on the achievements of the China-Central Asia mechanism, mutually beneficial cooperation within the framework, as well as international and regional hotspot issues, and lay out the top-level plan for China's relations with five Central Asian countries."
"It is the first time that the China-Central Asia Summit will be held in a Central Asian country, marking ""the beginning of a golden era of regional cooperation"" and ""another milestone in China-Central Asia cooperation."" The high praise from Central Asian media reflects the regional countries' sincere expectations for the summit to further advance the building of a China-Central Asia community with a shared future."
"China and the Central Asian countries share deep historical ties, broad practical needs, and a solid foundation of public support. In May 2023, the first China-Central Asia Summit was held in Xi'an, marking the official launch of the China-Central Asia cooperation mechanism and ushering in a new phase in the relationship between China and Central Asian countries. At the Xi'an summit, President Xi laid out ""four principles"" for building a China-Central Asia community with a shared future and put forward eight proposals for advancing cooperation, charting a clear direction and roadmap for the relationship. Stretching over 3,000 kilometers from Xi'an to Astana, this axis of cooperation not only carries the enduring friendship of the ancient Silk Road but also brings rare certainty to a world in flux, serving as a model of solidarity and collaboration among Global South countries."
"China and Central Asian countries are companions on the path toward modernization. Since President Xi proposed building a Silk Road Economic Belt in Kazakhstan in September 2013, Central Asia has become one of the regions with the most implemented projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The cooperation between the two sides is marked not only by its scale but also by its quality."
"During the first five months of 2025, China's total trade with the five Central Asian countries reached 286.42 billion yuan ($39.93 billion), grew by 10.4 percent year-on-year, setting a new record compared with corresponding periods in the previous years. The China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline has transports over 500 billion cubic meters of natural gas to China cumulatively. The China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway, currently under construction, will provide Kyrgyzstan with its first direct route to the sea. China-Europe freight trains passing through Central Asia have built bridges of mutual benefit and shared prosperity. Meanwhile, Confucius Institutes and Luban Workshops have cultivated a large number of talents proficient in cross-cultural communication and emerging engineering technologies. The ""two-way efforts"" between China and Central Asian countries are more than a rising curve on a data chart; they are reflected in the smiles of the people, giving real, tangible warmth to the phrase ""win-win cooperation."""
"Faced with global challenges such as unilateralism and protectionism, China and Central Asian countries are confidently demonstrating a model of mutual respect, sustainable development, and win-win cooperation - this comment from Central Asian media accurately summarizes the core values of cooperation between China and Central Asian countries. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations over 30 years ago, China and Central Asian countries have consistently adhered to the principles of mutual respect, friendly neighborliness, shared development, and win-win cooperation, setting a new model for international relations."
"As the pattern - where China has developed comprehensive strategic partnerships with all Central Asian countries, signed Belt and Road Initiative cooperation agreements with all Central Asian countries, and practiced the idea of a community with a shared future at the bilateral level with all Central Asian countries - has taken shape; and as the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative have taken root and flourished in the Central Asian region, the vibrant cooperation between China and Central Asian countries in fostering an amicable, secure and prosperous neighborhood has transformed the region into a hopeful ground for mutual benefit and harmonious coexistence."
"China and Central Asian countries, both part of the Global South countries, are committed to practicing true multilateralism. Within multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia, China closely cooperates with Central Asian countries. Both sides jointly defend multilateralism, firmly support each other on issues concerning core interests, stand up for each other at critical moments, safeguard each other's legitimate rights and strategic interests, promote the democratization of international relations, and advance the international order toward a more just and equitable direction."
"Kazakhstan has a saying: ""Where there is agreement, there is happiness."" When the leaders of the six countries shake hands again in Astana, the second China-Central Asia Summit will certainly become a grand event for further building consensus, deepening cooperation, and promoting the construction of a closer China-Central Asia community with a shared future. As good neighbors, good partners, good friends, and good brothers, China and Central Asian countries will use greater wisdom and responsibility to elevate China-Central Asia relations to a new level, making new and greater contributions to the peace, stability, and prosperity of the region and the world."
