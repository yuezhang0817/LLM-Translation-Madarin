What has China done right to attract rising global favorability?: Global Times editorial
"The US political news outlet Axios, citing a poll conducted by the American firm Morning Consult covering 41 countries, reported that China's global favorability has been on a steady upward trajectory over the past year, with a notable acceleration since March of this year. As of the end of May, China had an 8.8 net favorability rating, compared to -1.5 for the US. This marks the first time since the tracking began that China's global favorability has surpassed that of the US in this metric. This is not an isolated case - numerous international surveys in recent years have pointed to the same trend: The world is viewing China with increasing warmth and positivity."
"The increase in global favorability is due to China's role as a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order. These efforts and achievements have had a positive impact on the international community. China's development and progress have not only benefited its own people but have also made significant contributions to world peace and development. China's contribution to global economic growth remains around 30 percent, with its economic growth rate ranking among the highest of major economies in the world. The Belt and Road Initiative, now over a decade old, has become a source of tangible, visible change in the daily lives of countless ordinary people. In Africa, hydropower stations built with the involvement of Chinese companies have brought light to numerous households. In Southeast Asia, industrial parks supported by Chinese technology and investment are rapidly rising from the ground. These projects come with no political strings attached, no lectures or condescension - just a sincere response to partner countries' urgent aspirations for economic development and improved livelihoods. What the world is witnessing is China's inclusiveness and goodwill that true development means developing together."
"From facilitating the reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran to actively implementing the Paris Agreement, from promoting the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership to expanding the BRICS cooperation mechanism, China has demonstrated the image of a responsible major power to the world. Behind this lies the guidance of advanced concepts and the support of practical actions. Since their inception, the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative have received positive responses and support from over 100 countries and international organizations, injecting valuable stability and positive energy into a turbulent world. By actively contributing to global development assistance projects, promoting political solutions to hotspot issues, and injecting new vitality into civilizational dialogue, China has accurately grasped the trends of the times, focused on the common well-being of humanity, and reflected the shared aspirations of people around the world for peace and development, thereby gaining increasingly broad global recognition."
"The rise in China's global favorability also reflects growing international recognition and respect for a confident, self-reliant major power that stands for justice, supports the weak and promotes goodwill. In the face of rising unilateralism and protectionism, China remains firmly on the right side of history, advocating for the development of an open world economy. Confronted with hegemonism and power politics, China consistently upholds justice, acts with fairness, and staunchly defends an international order based on international law - working to make that order more just and equitable. At the same time, a country's positive global image is also reflected in the continuous growth of its soft power. Today, China's cultural creativity is embracing the world with unprecedented vitality. From Genshin Impact and Black Myth: Wukong to TikTok and Xiaohongshu (RedNote), and from the popularity of micro-dramas overseas to the DeepSeek phenomenon, as well as ""China Travel"" and influencers like IShowSpeed, these phenomena and products that exhibit ""breaking out of the cocoon"" effects have shattered the information bubble that Western media has long created, allowing the world to see a real China that is rich in technological innovation, steeped in historical depth, and characterized by warm and open-hearted people."
"The world's favorability toward China ultimately stems from the country's open-mindedness and confidence in the future. China understands well that openness brings progress, while isolation leads to stagnation. We continue to expand our ""visa-free circle of friends,"" shorten the negative list for foreign investment, and optimize the business environment to allow global enterprises to share in the dividends of China's development. According to a recent HSBC survey of over 5,700 transnational companies across 13 global markets, China is the most favored target market for increased business reliance. China's innovative breakthroughs in high-end manufacturing, green energy, and artificial intelligence not only drive its own high-quality development but also contribute ""Chinese solutions"" to addressing common challenges faced by humanity through advanced technologies and quality services."
"China's rising global favorability is no coincidence. It is the natural result of decades of dedicated hard work and peaceful development; the inevitable response to China's steadfast commitment to extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits under true multilateralism; and the collective portrait of an era, painted by countless Chinese enterprises, cultural workers, and ordinary citizens through sincere cooperation, innovative products, and warm smiles. It reflects recognition of China's path, affirmation of its contributions, and serves as a vivid testament to the growing resonance and grounding of the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind. It reminds us that the shaping of a major country's image lies not in aggressive rhetoric, but in quiet and consistent practice; not in a carefully crafted persona, but in the persistent pursuit of doing the right thing. By continuing on this path of win-win cooperation and inclusive openness, the image of a credible, appealing and respectable China will become ever clearer and warmer in the hearts of people around the world."
